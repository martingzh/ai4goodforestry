The Plan will guide and steer the Institute\ntowards contributing to realisation of Vision 2030's\naspiration of a globally competitive and prosperous nation\nwith a high quality of life by 2030\u2019. This Strategic Plan\nhas identified strategic themes, strategic results and\n\n \n\nstrategic objectives to guide the Institute in contributing\nto actualization of national development goals. The Plan Dr. Ben E. N. Chikamai\nsucceeds the 4 KEFRI Strategic Plan (2008-2012) that\n\nwas prepared in conformity with Vision 2030 and its First Medium Term Plan.\n\nKEFRI'\u2019s 4\" Strategic Plan research agenda was influenced by the Kenya Forest Master Plan\ndeveloped in 1995 that placed emphasis on establishment of forest-based programmes\nas vehicles for implementing forestry development activities in the country. The Plan\nwas implemented successfully as noted by the Midterm and End-of-Plan reviews. Key\nachievements included; a positive contribution to increase in the national forest cover\nto 6.9% surpassing the Vision 2030 First Medium Term Plan target of 4%, generation of\ntechnologies for rehabilitation of the five main water towers, and successful development\nand piloting of technologies for control and management of Prosopis invasion in Kenya.\n\nOther notable achievements during the 2008-2012 Plan include; strengthening institutional\ninfrastructure by building one office block each in Gede (Coast Eco-region), Turbo and\nMarigat (Rift Valley Eco-region), Kakamega (Lake Victoria Basin Eco-region) and Garissa\n(Drylands Eco-region), as well as a modern quarantine insectary at Muguga (Central\nHighlands Eco-region). Information Communication Technology (ICT) was deployed\nin Accounts, Supply Chain Management and Human Resource Divisions to increase\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\nTo conform to international standards of environmental management, the Institute\nwas ISO 14001:2004 EMS certified in June 2011. The 4\u00ae Strategic Plan period also\nsaw enhancement in resource mobilization from the exchequer, donor partners and\ninternal sources through establishment of Resource Mobilization and Enterprise offices.\n\na Kenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018", "Nevertheless, a number of challenges were noted. Key among the challenges were; weak\nreporting structures, poor alignment of objectives to budgetary provisions, and weak\nmonitoring and evaluation of performance against set targets.\n\nThis 5\u201c Strategic Plan has therefore been developed to build on gains made and lessons\nlearnt during implementation of the 4\" Strategic Plan. Specifically, in developing this Plan,\nthe Balance Score Card (BSC) was used as a new approach to setting and implementing\nobjectives and initiatives to enhance performance. The BSC is an integrated planning and\nmanagement system for establishing and communicating the organization's vision and\nmission to stakeholders and aligning operations to strategy.\n\nIn order to achieve the Institute\u2019s mission \u2018to conduct research and provide information\nand technologies for sustainable development of forestry and allied natural resources for\nsocio-economic development\u2019 this Strategic Plan has been developed taking cognisance\nof relevant flagship projects under Second Medium Term Plan of Vision 2030. The Plan\nis also aligned to the National Forestry Programme, which places emphasis on themes.\nConsequently, the Strategic Plan has emphasized on thematic, multi-sectoral, and multi-\ndisciplinary approach to research. The strategic objectives of the Plan have also been\naligned to the framework of performance contract requirements. The Institute will aim at\ndiversifying and improving research products and services to meet needs of customers and\nstakeholders. The Strategic Plan has incorporated necessary measures to ensure that robust\nmonitoring and evaluation is carried out to achieve the intended objectives and initiatives.\nBudget projections in this Strategic Plan are indicative and will be subject to\nannual revision based on evolving realities. Management will ensure effective\nimplementation of this Plan and call upon our internal and external stakeholders to\nsupport us towards being A centre of excellence in forestry research for development\u2019.\n\nBen E. N. Chikamai (PhD)\nDirector, KEFRI\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018 F", "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) embraced the concept of strategic planning\nin 1989 to guide its operations. This Strategic Plan for the period 2013-2018 is the fifth\nfor the Institute. The Strategic Plan was developed using the Balanced Score Card (BSC)\napproach, a performance management tool that enables alignment of an organization's\nstrategy to its vision and mission and uses performance measures to monitor progress.\n\nDevelopment of this Strategic Plan involved, among others, a review of the 4\" KEFRI\nStrategic Plan 2008-2012, which had been aligned to Kenya Vision 2030 and its First\nMedium Term Plan (MTP I). The Strategic Plan builds on progress of the 4 KEFRI\nStrategic Plan and is aligned to; Vision 2030 and its Second Medium Term Plan (MTP\nII), the Kenya Constitution, and as well as relevant national development plans such as\nthose outlined in the National Forestry Plan and the Ministry of Environment, Water and\nNatural Resources Strategic Plan.\n\nIn formulating this Strategic Plan, an assessment of both external and internal operating\nenvironment was undertaken. This involved undertaking strengths, weaknesses,\nopportunities and threats (SWOT) to determine what was feasible in the political,\neconomic, social, technological, legal, environmental and governance (PESTLEG) setting.\nA stakeholder analysis was also done and crosscutting institutional issues, which affect\nKEFRI\u2019s effectiveness in realising its mission, were established. Results of the, SWOT,\nPESTLEG and stakeholders analyses facilitated the review of KEFRI\u2019s Vision and Mission.\n\nKEFRI Mandate, Vision and Mission statements and Core Values to guide implementation\nof the 5\" Strategic Plan are:\n\nMandate:\ni) Conduct research in forestry and allied natural resources;\nii) Disseminate research findings; and\n\niii) | Establish partnerships and cooperate with other research organizations and\ninstitutions of higher learning in joint research and training.\n\nVision: A centre of excellence in forestry research for development\n\nMission: To conduct research and provide information and technologies for\nsustainable development of forestry and allied natural resources for\nsocio-economic development\n\nCore Values:\n\n- Creativity and Innovation\n- Professionalism\n= Integrity\n\n> Kenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018", "- Teamwork\n- Clean and Healthy Environment\n- Partnership\n\nIn order to achieve its Mission, KEFRI has identified strategic themes and strategic results\nto meet the needs of customers and stakeholders by delivering value through its products\nand services. Research in KEFRI during the Plan period will address five thematic research\nand development areas namely: Forest Productivity and Improvement (FPI); Biodiversity\nand Environment Management (BEM); Socio-Economics, Policy and Governance (SPG);\nForest Products Development (FPD); and Technical Support Services (TSS).\n\nFifteen strategic objectives, indicative actions and associated results were formulated. The\nstrategic objectives are based on four Balanced Score Card (BSC) perspectives namely;\ncustomers/stakeholders, financial, internal processes, and organizational capacity. The\ncorporate strategic objectives for the Plan period 2013-2018 are as shown in the following\ntable:\n\n \n\n   \n\n     \n    \n   \n\nPerspective Objectives\n\n \n\nEnhance Vision 2030 delivery\n\n   \n\n   \n    \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n\nCustomer / Enhance customer/stakeholder satisfaction and retention\n\nstakeholder\n\n   \n\nEnhance linkages and partnerships with stakeholders\nEnhance livelihoods\n\n. .

The Institute intends to finance this budget through; the\nannual Government of Kenya allocation, development partners, Public-Private Sector\nPartnerships, and internal revenue generation. The Institute will strengthen its resource\nmobilisation strategies in order to raise more finances.\n\nDetailed workplans and implementation matrices will act as tools for monitoring\nimplementation progress of the Strategic Plan. This will be done by linking planning,\nbudgeting and reporting through annual workplans, performance contracts and periodic\nreporting. The Institute shall employ a Risk Management Strategy in mitigating risks\nassociated with implementation of the strategic objectives. An organization structure has\nbeen developed to ensure proper alignment of resources with the Institute's mission and\ncore functions. This will enable the Institute to play its role as a facilitator in development\nand conservation of forests and the environment.\n\n>, Kenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018", "CHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) is a state corporation established in 1986,\nunder the Science and Technology Act (Cap 250) of the Laws of Kenya. The Act has since\nbeen repealed by the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Act No. 28 of 2013. The\nInstitute is under the Environmental Protection, Water and Natural Resources Sector,\nand undertakes research to generate and promote improved technologies for sustainable\nmanagement, conservation and development of forests and allied natural resources. KEFRI\nis ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management Systems (EMS) certified and conforms to\ninternational standards on environmental management and relevant national legislations.\n\nKEFRI embraced the concept of strategic planning in 1989. The first strategic plan\n(1989-2000) was discipline based. The second (1999-2004) and the third (2005-2010)\nstrategic plans were based on programmes as outlined in the Kenya Forest Master Plan\n(KFMP), while the fourth (2008-2012) was based on the same programmes and also\naligned to the First Medium Term Plan (MTP JI) of Vision 2030. This strategic plan for\nthe period 2013-2018 is the fifth for the Institute and focuses on multidisciplinary, multi-\nsectoral and thematic research (Annex I). The fifth strategic plan will implement relevant\nareas in: the Second Medium Term Plan (MTP II) of Vision 2030; National Forestry Plan;\nand Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources Strategic Plan; in line with the\nConstitution of Kenya 2010.\n\n1.2 Mandate\n\nThe mandate of KEFRI is to:\ni) Conduct research in forestry and allied natural resources;\nii) Disseminate research findings; and\n\niii) Establish partnerships and cooperate with other research organizations and\ninstitutions of higher learning in joint research and training.\n\n1.3. Review of KEFRI Strategic Plan 2008-2012\n1.3.1 Policy and Legal Framework\n\nDevelopment of KEFRI Strategic Plan 2008-2012 was informed by two key policy\ndocuments: the Kenya Forest Master Plan (KFMP 1995-2020) and the First Medium Term\nPlan of Vision 2030 whose goals were closely linked to Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). KEFRI therefore established four core research programmes (Farm Forestry,\nNatural Forests, Drylands Forestry and Industrial Forest Plantations), three research\nsupport programmes (Tree Seed, Technology Dissemination and Service Programme, and\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018 a7", "Partnership and Networks) and a Corporate Affairs and Public Relations office. These\nprogrammes focused on; development of technologies and products, as well as provision\nof services for conservation and management of forestry resources.\n\nThe KFMP was instrumental in formulation of the Draft Forest Policy and Forests\nAct, 2005. In the Act, the focus for forest management shifted from central control by\nthe Forest Department to a more participatory approach driven by Community Forest\nAssociations (CFAs). KEFRI contributed to implementation of the Forests Act, 2005\nthrough development of guidelines and capacity building of communities in participatory\nforest management.\n\nDuring the 2008-2012 Strategic Plan implementation period, the Government embarked\non developing a National Forest Programme to review the KFMP and develop a 10-year\nplan in the framework of international agreements. KEFRI actively participated and\ncontributed in drafting the proposed National Forestry (Conservation and Management)\nBill, which is intended to review the Forest Act, 2005 and provide a clear strategy for\nimplementation of the Forest Policy.\n\nIn the First Medium Term Plan (2008-2012) of Vision 2030, forestry was categorized under\nthe Environment, Water and Sanitation Sector. KEFRI contributed to the sector targets\nthrough development and promotion of technologies for; conservation of water towers\nand woodlands, increased forest and tree cover, management of invasive plant species\nparticularly Prosopis, and management of industrial forest plantations.\n\n1.3.2 Major Achievements\n\nThe Institute made the following achievements under the various research, support and\ndevelopment programmes:\n\n1.3.2.1 Farm Forestry Research Programme\n\n\u00b0 Developed technologies including use of leguminous trees and shrubs for\nbiomass transfer and improved fallows to enhance soil fertility and land\nproductivity\n\n\u00b0 Selected and popularized high value tree species, including Grevillea robusta,\n\nEucalyptus species, Casuarina species, Markhamia lutea, Gmelina arborea and\nvarious varieties of mangoes for on-farm planting in diverse ecological zones\n\n\u00b0 Established 20 hectares of seed orchards for selected tree species to provide high\nquality seed for on-farm tree growing\n\n\u00b0 Promoted commercial tree farming in Coast, Central, Rift Valley and Western\nKenya regions\n\n>, Kenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018", "iNicsaeleC Me meer Ke Belay\n\n   \n\n \n\nLee a ae\n\nCommunity training on rehabilitation of degraded forests", "Gums harvested from Acacia senegal\n\n \n\nFarmers\u2019 field day on management of Melia volkensii", "1.3.2.4 Industrial Forest Plantations Research Programme\n\n\u00b0 Developed high yielding Eucalyptus grandis variety\n\n\u00b0 Developed methods for surveillance and management of tree pests and diseases\n\n\u00b0 Provided advisory services on forest pests and diseases\n\n\u00b0 Established 31 ha of seed orchards and 22 ha of seed stands to provide high\nquality seed for plantation tree species\n\n\u00b0 Developed web-based Decision Support System for growing Grevillea robusta\n\n \n\ni i a;\nod \u2019 i lla i i\n\nEucalyptus poles for income generation\n\n1.3.2.5 Tree Seed Programme\n\n\u00b0 Produced and distributed 51 tonnes of high quality tree seed\n\n\u00b0 Decentralized seed supply to KEFRI regional centres, and seed stockists\n\u00b0 Selected, registered and mapped 20 seed sources\n\n\u00b0 Identified and trained tree seed stockists across the country\n\n1.3.2.6 Technology Dissemination and Service Programme\n\n\u00b0 Published 110 scientific papers and extension materials\n\n\u00b0 Conducted 5 Regional Social Forestry, 15 Participatory Natural Resource\nManagement and 15 Nursery Establishment and Management courses\n\n\u00b0 Held 30 open days, 70 field days, 15 radio talks, 7 TV shows and participated in\n\n20 ASK shows\n\u00b0 Published 20 print media features\n\u00b0 Organized and hosted a National Forestry Scientific Conference and an\n\nInternational (IUFRO-FORNESSA) Forestry Congress\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018 <7", "sisTIUFRO BOARD MEETING\n\n    \n\nParticipants of IUFRO meeting hosted by KEFRI", "1.3.2.8 Corporate Affairs and Public Relations\n\n\u00b0 Re-branded 2 regional centres for focused research and to raise KEFRI profile in\nthe respective eco-regions and counties\n\u00b0 Developed and launched KEFRI Service Charter\n\n1.3.2.9 Institutional Capacity Building\n\n(a) Infrastructural Development\n\n\u00b0 Constructed one office block each in Gede, Garissa, Turbo, Kakamega and\nMarigat research centres, a modern quarantine insectary at KEFRI headquarters\nand renovated Lodwar sub-centre\n\n\u00b0 Upgraded hostels at KEFRI headquarters and Kitui Regional Research Centre\n\n(b) Human Resource Development\n\n\u00b0 Trained scientists at doctorate (8), masters (6) and undergraduate (10) levels\n\n\u00b0 Carried out the following skills improvement courses: Information\nCommunication Technology;

The Ministry is responsible for implementing policies, strategies\nand development plans for conservation, protection and management of the environment,\nwater and natural resources.\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018 J", "", "The following is a summary of KEFRI\u2019s contribution to the Ministry\u2019s strategic objectives\nand activities:\n\n2.3.1 Forest Policy\n\nThe overall goal of the Draft Forest Policy, 2014 is sustainable development, management,\nutilization and conservation of forest resources and equitable sharing of accrued benefits\nfor the present and future generations of the people of Kenya. The policy recognizes that\nkey decisions on forest management and conservation shall be informed by forestry science\nfounded on appropriate knowledge derived from research and best practices. KEFRI will\ncontinue to contribute to achievement of objectives of the Policy through generation\nand transfer of appropriate technologies for forestry development including; production\nof sufficient planting materials, forest management, conversion and processing of wood\nand non-wood forest products, value addition and capacity building of stakeholders.\n\n2.3.2. National Forestry (Conservation and Management) Bill 2013\n\nThe Bill provides for establishment, development and sustainable management of forest\nresources for socio-economic development of the country. KEFRI will generate technologies\nfor sustainable management of forests and woodlands, and contribute to Environmental\nImpact Assessment as well as development of: management plans; regulations and guidelines\nfor protection and regeneration of protected species; and guidelines for participatory\nforest management. The Institute will also provide technical advice regarding: forest\nbiodiversity; rare, threatened, or endangered species; and appropriate forestry practices.\n\n2.3.3 National Forest Programme\n\nNational forest programmes have been globally advocated as tools for forestry\ndevelopment. The Kenya Government has initiated a process of developing a National\nForest Programme (NFP) to review the Kenya Forest Master Plan (1995-2020) and\ndevelop a ten-year plan in the framework of international agreements. The NFP is a\nlong term phased process, structured in themes, and aimed at ensuring sustainable\nmanagement of forests. In this Strategic Plan, KEFRI has changed its research framework\nfrom programme based research to multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary and thematic\nresearch approach and aligned its research activities to NFP themes and activities.\n\n2.3.4 National Climate Change Response Strategy, 2010\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognized climate\nchange as one of the most serious threats to sustainable development globally.\nThis recognition resulted in a series of Conference of Parties (COPs) to address\ninternational environmental and developmental challenges. Two of the significant\n\nKenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018 a7", "outcomes of these meetings were the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and Marrakesh\nAccords, which commit parties to meeting emission reduction targets. It is in this respect\nthat the government of Kenya developed the National Climate Change Response Strategy\n(NCCRS) 2010, which recognizes that climate change and variability are likely to increase\npressure on forests.\n\nKEFRI will play a critical role in disseminating information for implementation of the\nfollowing adaptation mechanisms identified in the National Climate Change Response\nStrategy: (i) promotion of afforestation and reforestation programmes (ii) promotion\nof agro-forestry (iii) promotion of forestry based alternative livelihood options\n(iv) promotion of; alternative energy sources, energy conservation initiatives,\nand efficient charcoal production and utilisation technologies (v) involving\nforest-dependent rural communities in management of forests (vi) improving\ntimber yields and (vii) reducing the chances of pest and disease attacks.\n\nKEFRI will also play a significant role in various climate change mitigation interventions\nby developing technologies for; restoration of the country\u2019s forest cover, rehabilitation\nand restoration of degraded forests and riverine vegetation, and sustainable management\nand utilization of industrial forest plantations. The Institute will also build capacity in\nmitigation of climate change.\n\n2.3.5 Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2014\n\nThe act provides for protection, conservation, sustainable use and management of wildlife\nin Kenya. KEFRI will contribute to development of integrated management plans and\nundertake environmental impact assessment for conservation and management of protected\nareas, such as wetlands and marine resources especially mangroves, which are important\nhabitats for wildlife. The Institute will also contribute to development of measures, rules,\nguidelines, procedures and regulations for effective conservation and management of\nplant resources in protected areas. In addition, KEFRI will provide information on areas\nthat are rich in plant biodiversity or contain endangered and threatened plant species.\n\n2.3.6 Water\n\nKenya is a water scarce country with renewable fresh water per capita at 647 m\u2019\nagainst the United Nations recommended minimum of 1000 m\u00b0*. The country\nfaces enormous challenges in the development and management of its limited\nwater resources which are critical to other sectors of the economy. KEFRI plays a\nsignificant role in generation of technologies for rehabilitation of the five major water\ntowers, evaluation of status of water catchments, and building capacity of relevant\nstakeholders in management of water resources, thus improving water availability.\n\n>, Kenya Forestry Research Institute Strategic Plan 2013-2018", "2.3.7. Environment\n\nThe major development goal anticipated by Vision 2030 is having a better quality of life for\npresentand future generations through sustainable management ofenvironmentand natural\nresources. Emerging challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, desertification\nand land degradation require research interventions. KEFRI played a significant role in\ndevelopment of the Draft National Environment Policy and continues to contribute to the\nfollowing: innovative strategies to increase forest and tree cover to at least 10%; appropriate\nforest-based technologies in emerging Green Economy such as carbon markets under the\nREDD+, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES), and capacity building of stakeholders.\n\n2.4 Science, Technology and Innovation Act, 2013\n\nThe Science, Technology and Innovation Act No. 28 of 2013 facilitates the promotion,\nco-ordination and regulation of the progress of science, technology and innovation of\nthe country; assigns priority to development of science, technology and innovation; and\nentrenches science, technology and innovation into the national production system.\nCurrently, KEFRI exists under STI Act No. 28 of 2013 and will be implementing the\nfollowing in line with STI Act: development of technologies and innovations in forestry\nand allied natural resources; patenting of innovations; documenting, disseminating and\npromoting scientific information and knowledge that can be utilized by stakeholders; and\ncapacity building of stakeholders.\n\n2.5 Contribution to Other Sectors\n\nKEFRI plays a direct or indirect role in other related areas of the economy which include;\nEnergy, Agriculture, Industrialization, Health, Education and training, and Tourism.\n\nEnergy: Biomass energy contributes over 80% of Kenya's national energy needs. This\nscenario is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. An analysis of supply and\ndemand of woodfuel shows that the country is currently unable to meet its woodfuel\nrequirements. By the year 2020, annual woodfuel demand will be about 53 million tonnes\nwhile the supply would only be about 20 million tonnes, occasioning an annual deficit\nof 33 million tonnes. KEFRI has a role in development of technologies for management\nof trees for woodfuel in various ecosystems and diversification of tree species to increase\nproductivity. The Institute also plays a role in the development of technologies for efficient\ncharcoal production and utilization and promotion of appropriate technologies to reduce\nwastage of biomass.

total staff establishment of 965 comprising 86 research\nscientists, 109 technical staff, 333 professional support staff and 437 auxiliary staff. Based\non a staff strength analysis, the optimum staffing level required to deliver this Strategic\nPlan is 1200 giving a variance of 235 staffing gap. The variance in the staffing levels and\nskills required will be bridged through: recruitment to bring new talent; use of internships\nand students on attachment in order to empower the youths; contracted staff for some\nprojects or short term assignments; systematic training to equip existing staff with relevant\nskills, knowledge and attitudes.\n\nA training needs assessment conducted in 2010/2011 showed that relevant skills,\nknowledge and attitudes of existing staff could be improved further for delivering this\nStrategic Plan. Priority training areas will include; team building, ISO 14001:2004 EMS\nand ISO 9001:2008 QMS implementation, data management, nursery management,\ntime management, supervisory skills, strategic leadership and change management,\nperformance improvement, and staff performance management.

KEFRI will also continuously identify research and development\npriorities and financial gaps and link them to existing funding opportunities including;\n\ni. Targeted fundraising \u2014The Institute will proactively engage and tap resources\nfrom Development Partners and Corporate bodies. The approach will be to\ncollate overarching ideas that enhance strategic targeting of major investors.\n\nii. Competitive grants \u2014 The Institute will respond to calls for proposals from\ndonors, foundations and other partners and utilize such funds for investment\nin research and development.\n\niii, Campaigns - KEFRI will identify critical partners, for instance, consulting\nfirms for strategic campaigns to mobilize resources by developing innovative\nbusiness and investment plans. KEFRI will therefore launch major campaigns\ntargeting bilateral donors in Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa and\nwithin a wide range of philanthropies.\n\niv. Traditional fundraising partnerships - KEFRI will consolidate and\nstrengthen existing fundraising partnerships from traditional supporters.\n\nv.
