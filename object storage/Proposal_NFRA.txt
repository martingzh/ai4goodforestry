Forests have a key role in mitigating climate change,\npreserving biodiversity, maintaining water catchments, producing various goods and services, providing\nlivelihood and increasing food security. To manage and develop forests in environmentally, economically and\nsocially sustainable way, it is crucial to have accurate information on forest and tree resources. This implies\nthat all land use areas growing trees, and all forest products and services including commercially grown tree\nspecies must be assessed accurately. Comprehensive and representative information provides a basis for\nnational-level analyses and strategic planning, and enables knowledge-based decision making. Data that is\ncorrectly and accurately collected (right design, correctly measured with minimum error) and statistically\nanalysed data and time series increase knowledge of trends in forests and understanding of interactions\nbetween forests and other land uses.\n\nIn Vision 2030 forests are identified as one of the key drivers of the economy in Kenya, and the overall goal is\nto conserve natural resources; using them wisely in a sustainable manner without compromising economic\ngrowth (Kenya 2007). Consequently, forest policy aims to ensure adequate supply of forest products and\nservices by increasing forest cover from the current 6.9% to 10% through environmental conservation and\ntree-planting. National strategies should take cognizance of the country\u2019s commitments to international\nconventions and processes, such as Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest\nDegradation (REDD), sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+).\nInformation requirements in these processes and in other international reporting, e.g. FAO\u2019s Global Forest\nResources Assessment (FRA) (FAO, 2012, 2013), are similar as in the national forest policy: accurate,\nconsistent and representative information on forest resources, products and services at regular intervals.\n\nSustainable forest management is defined and assessed by criteria and indicators that are tools for measuring\nand monitoring the status and changes in a forest. The indicators should capture quantitative and qualitative\ninformation on the following thematic areas (FAO, 2003): 1) Extent of forest resources; 2) Forest biological\ndiversity; 3) Forest health and vitality; 4) Productive functions of forest resources; 5) Protective functions of\nforest resources; 6) Socio-economic functions of forest; and 7) Legal, policy and institutional framework. The\nforest resources in this context encompass also trees outside forests (TOF).\n\nThe main challenges in REDD+ and reporting to UNFCCC include assessing carbon emissions by various\nsources and removals by sinks, and changes in carbon stocks over time (IPCC, 2006). The Government of\nKenya has committed herself to submitting UNFCCC a National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory report\nevery four years. The REDD+ mechanism under UNFCCC in turn provides incentives to climate change\nmitigation activities and the payments are based on credible evidence of the achievements. To assess forest\ncarbon stocks and verify REDD+ activities, the country must establish a transparent monitoring system for\nmeasurement, reporting and verification (MRV) which captures both drastic changes such as deforestation and\nfelling (clear felling or selective felling) and gradual changes related to growth or degradation (UNFCCC,\n2010). Given that mitigation activities are likely to affect availability of other forest products and services\nespecially at the local level, information on other uses and values are required to help in forest management\nand optimizing total benefits.\n\nCurrently, the quantity, quality and trends in growth and yield of forest and tree resources are poorly known\nespecially outside gazetted forests in Kenya. It is only from state plantations that sufficient data on the\ngrowing stock available was collected in Natural Resource Management project (NRM) in 2008 \u2014 2011 for\noperative forest management planning. At the national level, there is no accurate, comprehensive and up-to-\ndate information on forest biomass and volume to provide for strategic management planning and forest\npolicy processes. The estimates of forest coverage and its changes are based on satellite remote sensing (FPP\n2013) and volume estimates on partial or outdated inventories. Satellite imagery is adequate in assessing\ndrastic changes such as deforestation or clear felling but not for growth or degradation. Regarding forest", "carbon stocks by five pools (above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, dead wood, litter and soil), there\nis limited information based on research on restricted areas or global allometric functions. However, accurate\ndata at the national level is lacking.\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nThe Government of Kenya (GoK) is in the process of developing a national greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting\nand reporting system as part of the National REDD+ Programme and establishing a National Forest\nMonitoring System. This document is a proposal for a National Forest Resources Assessment (NFRA) design\nand (technical) implementation in Kenya. The suggested NFRA is based on statistical sampling procedures\nand includes both a biophysical field inventory and a socioeconomic survey. The NFRA will produce accurate\ninformation on the current status of forest resources at the national level and form a sound basis for the\nmonitoring system. Repeated field inventories will provide information on changes, for example, in land use,\nforest cover and biomass, for monitoring purposes. The socioeconomic survey will provide data for analysing\nthe driving forces behind the changes.\n\nWith regard to the national forest policy and management, the NFRA will produce information on indicators\nof sustainable forest management. The indicators are attributes that can be measured and help in monitoring\nthe status and changes in forests. The information produced by the NFRA will cover thematic areas of\nsustainable forest management (FAO, 2003) required for the global FRA reporting (FAO, 2013). The main\ninformation produced by the NFRA can be summarized as follows:\n1. area by land use categories and forest types, by dominant tree species, age classes etc. (changes in\nforest area through repeated inventories);\n\nproductive and protective functions of forest resources; and\nsocio-economic functions of forest.\n\n2. volume and biomass of the growing stock including trees outside forests (TOF);\n3. change in the growing stock (through repeated inventories);\n\n4. carbon stocks by the five carbon pools defined in the IPCC guidelines;\n\n5. forest biodiversity;\n\n6. forest health and vitality;\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\nFor the international reporting to the UNFCCC, the NFRA will cover all five carbon pools on forest land and\nadditionally, part of the pools on all land use areas (Table 1). Due to the optimized NFRA sampling design,\nsoil and litter sampling is carried out only on forest land in the NFRA, and therefore, litter and soil organic\ncarbon on other lands such as agricultural or pasture land are not covered by the proposed NFRA.\n\nTable 1.

A pilot inventory in five test areas in different vegetation types was\ncarried out during the project and in the planning of the proposed NFRA sampling design, the forest data\nmeasured during the pilot inventory was utilized. Moreover, the suggested measurements, technology and", "applications in data recording and calculations were tested in the pilot inventory, and gained experiences were\nutilized in improving this proposal.\n\n1.3 Institutional framework\n\nNational forest monitoring is a continuous undertaking that should be institutionalized. Technical\nimplementation of a NFRA requires long-term availability of expertise, availability of data and data\nmanagement tools and adequate infrastructure for further improvement. This is best guaranteed by a\npermanent NFRA organization built on existing capacity within the national administration. Integration of the\nNFRA into a government institutional framework will create a legal and financial basis for the long-term\nfunctioning and development of the system. It will also demonstrate the country\u2019s ownership and commitment\nto the forest monitoring task, and in line with the strategy of National Forest Assessment and Monitoring in\nthe National Forest Programme (NFP) prepared by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and\nRegional Development Authority (MENR+RDA).\n\nIn a forest monitoring system, the implementing organization must have a clear mandate for the task to get\naccess to all land, to get access to relevant background data and to facilitate long-term planning, investments\nand capacity building. In Kenya, the mandate of a NFRA is not given to any institution in the legislation.\nThere are two government institutions in the forest sector; the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and the Kenya\nForestry Research Institute (KEFRI) with competence and technical capability for the NFRA. Currently the\nKFS in consultation with the County Government has a duty to prepare a Forest Status Report and a Resource\nAssessment report on the public forests every two and five years respectively (Forest Conservation and\nManagement Bill, 2014). The Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRIJ) in turn shall provide information\nand technologies for sustainable development of forest resources.\n\nThe MENR+RDA should have the overall responsibility for formulating and mandating the NFRA\nimplementation. Constituting a NFRA, or more broadly a Forest Monitoring unit, i.e. entity in organization\nstructure within an existing institution, is recommended. Technical implementation of the NFRA will require\noperational capacity and expertise in various fields, such as forest mensuration, statistics, remote sensing and\ninformation technology, which does not exist in one institution. Consequently, the NFRA will require national\ncooperation, recruitment of new experts and experienced staff, and continuous capacity building in order to\nensure sustainability.\n\nThe KFS has strong experience in operational forest inventory and expertise in international processes\n(FAO/FRA, REDD+), and KEFRI in the fields of soil carbon analyses, inventory research and development,\nand quality control. It is recommended that the NFRA unit will be built on these institutional capacities. A\nformally assigned mandate and a permanent NFRA structure with clear responsibilities are essential for\noperational efficiency and sustainability. In strengthening research and capacity in forest monitoring, the\nNFRA unit should cooperate with the Universities, especially with the University of Eldoret (UoE) having a\nschool of natural resource management and the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology\n(JKUAT) with expertise in information technology. In the field of Remote Sensing (RS) and forest mapping,\ncooperation with DRSRS is recommended.\n\nThe NFRA also needs cross-sectoral coordination and linkages with national and global stakeholders to\nresponse to their information needs. The NFRA and monitoring system will provide extensive information,\nnot only on tree and forest resources but also on land use, biodiversity, non-timber and non-wood forest\nproducts and services, and socio-economics. The collected and generated information will support policy\nprocesses and decision making at different levels, including outside the forest sector.\n\nThe NFRA stakeholders include at least the following national institutions: DRSRS, KWS, KEMFRI, UoE,\nJKUAT, MENR, ERMIS, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), Natural Museums of Kenya, Forestry\nSociety of Kenya, Survey of Kenya, Metrological Institute and County governments. The most important\ninternational stakeholders are FAO, ICRAF, UNDP, UNEP and WB.", "2 Sampling design\n\n2.1 Sampling method\n\nDue to geographical and climatic conditions, there is a large variation in forest biomass, and consequently in\nforest carbon storage, between regions in Kenya. The forests are scattered and concentrated in favourable,\nhumid areas in South-West Kenya. In addition, the size of certain vegetation types such as mangroves is small\ncompared to the other vegetation types, for example, grasslands and farm forests. To provide results on forest\nresources with required accuracy and cost-efficiently for the whole country, a double stratified two-phase\nsampling method is recommended for the NFRA in Kenya.\n\nIn this method, stratification is applied in both sampling phases. First, the country is divided into geographical\nstrata according to the agro-ecological zones and administrative units. The stratification improves the\nprecision of results, for example, biomass and volume estimates, if the forest structure is homogenous, i.e.\nvariation of biomass is low within a stratum and heterogeneous (variation is high) between strata. The\ngeographical stratification also enables the use of different sampling designs in different strata.\n\nThe first-phase sample is a dense grid of clusters of sample plots systematically laid over the whole country.\nOnly a part of the clusters is measured in the field and to select this second-phase sample optimally, the\nclusters are further stratified into second-phase strata according to the number of forested sample plots in a\ncluster. Technically, the sample plots are interpreted as forest or non-forest on the basis of auxiliary data\navailable prior to the field measurements. The stratification enables selection forested clusters with a higher\nprobability, and thus, putting more emphasis on the sampling of forested clusters in the field (more weight\ngiven to forested clusters compared to their counter parts).\n\nThe recommended sampling design is based on a simulation study conducted in the IC-FRA project. The\nsimulation technique and results are described in detail in a technical report (Appendix 1) and an overview of\nresults is given in the sections which follow.\n\n2.2 _\u2014_ Land use of Kenya and Stratification\n\nThe total area of Kenya is 58.0 million ha, of this 1.1 million ha are inland water bodies. Kenya is composed\nof seven different agro-ecological zones (Figure 1). The land consists of 82% arid and semi-arid land (ASAL)\nand 18% humid to semi-humid land.\n\nThe official estimate of the forest cover in Kenya is 6.9% of the land area (Forest Preservation Programme,\n2013). This area comprises natural forests, plantation forests, open woodlands and a small amount of\nmangrove forests in coast. The most luxuriant forests are found in the humid to semi-humid areas in Western\nKenya, the montane areas and in the coast. According to the Land Use (LU) map by the Forest Preservation\nProgramme (FPP, 2013) most forest plantations are found in Central and Western Kenya (Figure 1).\n\nThe ASAL zone extends over the whole Northern and Eastern Kenya except the lower south East (Lamu\nCounty where Boni forest is found) and according to the LU map, the main land use type in these areas is\ngrassland (Figure 1). In the ASAL area, there are also scattered natural forests which are, however, small in\narea.\n\nAlong the coastal strip of Kenya there are unique forests, namely mangrove forests. Mangrove forests are\nscattered along the coastline. The most common tree genera are Rhizophora, Ceriops and Avicenia. The\nlargest continuous mangrove forests are found in Lamu, Gazi and Mombasa areas.\n\nIn principle, vegetation types and forest structure follow the agro-ecological zones. Forests with large amounts\nof above-ground biomass (AGB) are found in humid to semi-humid zones and forests with less AGB are\nfound in arid areas. However, below-ground biomass (BGB) can be high also on arid areas, as was found out\nin the IC-FRA pilot inventory when the soil samples were analysed.", "Land Use of Kenya\n\niil Plantation forest\na Bamboo\n\n[J cropiana\nGrassland\niz Mangrove\n|i Natural forest\n|__| Otherlana\nia Settlements\nWetlands\n\nQ 50 100\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nL1__}\nKilometers\n\nFigure 1. Land use map of Kenya (FPP, 2013).\n\nAs the agro-ecological zones are quite different in respect of vegetation and biomass, it is recommended that\nthe country should be divided into different strata according to these zones. The delineation of agro-ecological\nzones is, however, ambiguous on the ground, and therefore, the division should also follow some spatially\nexplicit boundaries such as administrative units. The suggested geographic strata are shown in Figure 2 and\ndescribed in the following section. The areas of land use classes and forest types are based on the LU map\n(Figure 1).\n\nStratum 1: grasslands\n\nThe area of Stratum 1 is about 355,000 square kilometres (km?) and the share of forests is about 3.9% of the\nland area (Table 2). According to the LU map, there are only natural forests in Stratum1. The most common\nland use class is grassland with a share of 93.4% of the land area.\n\nStratum 2: forested areas\n\nThe area of Stratum 2 is about 210,000 km? and forests cover about 12.0% of the land area. The most common\nforest type is natural forest (88.8% of the forest area). According to the LU map, plantation forests (7.9% of\nthe forest area) and bamboo forests (3.5%) are found only in this stratum.\n\nStratum 3: coastal areas\n\nThe area of Stratum 3 is about 27,000 km? and the most common land classes are grassland and cropland,\nwhich cover 48.7% and 37.5% of the land area, respectively. According to the LU map, there are scattered\nnatural forests covering about 12.8% of the land area in Stratum 3.\n\nStratum 4: mangroves\nThe area of Stratum 4 is about 1 000 km\u201d. This area also includes a buffer zone (100 m) around the mangrove\nforests. The actual area of mangrove forests is approximately 700 km\u2019.

Two-phase sampling\n\nThe first-phase sample consists of clusters of sample plots systematically laid, in a distance of 2 km-by-2 km\n(4 km\u2019 grids) over the whole country. This density results in a total amount of ca. 148 100 clusters in the\ncountry. The map projection applied was UTM-37S/Arc 1960 and the first sample plot location was allocated\nrandomly to enable estimation of valid probability values.\n\nTo select the second-phase sample, i.e. the clusters to be measured in the field, the clusters were further\nstratified into three strata according to the number of forested sample plots in a cluster (Table 3). In\n\n11", "classifying the sample plots as forest and non-forest, the land use map of Kenya produced by Forest\nPreservation Programme (FPP, 2013) was used.\n\nThe intensity of the second-phase sample, i.e. the amount of clusters to be measured in the field in each\ngeographical stratum, was then determined by optimizing the precision of the main variable of interest with\nthe time cost as a limiting factor. Specifically, an optimal allocation was obtained by minimizing the relative\nstandard error of the total biomass on forest land with the restriction of time consumption. To incorporate\nspatial balance to the second-phase sample, and hence, to achieve a representative sample of the whole\npopulation, a spatially balanced survey designer, Generalized random tessellation stratified (GTRS), was\napplied in the allocation.\n\nTable 3. Number of forested plots in a cluster in different second-phase strata (class).\n\npO Number of forested plots\nPo asst | Class | Class 3*\n\n*\n\n\u2018n\u201d is the maximum number of sample plots in a cluster.\n\n    \n\nA precondition was that the NFRA field measurements should not take more than three years, and it is\nassumed that 15 field teams will work in the field 8 months per year. According to the simulation study, the\ntime consumption of 55 000 hours in the field work, which is approximately 2.9 years, results in a second-\nphase sample of 5300 clusters which are allocated to the geographic strata as listed in Table 4. With this\napproach of allocation of the second-phase sample, the error of the total biomass estimate for the whole\ncountry is 1.54%. The errors of forest area and mean biomass estimates are 0.94% and 1.23%, respectively.\n\nThe two-phase sampling described above will produce accurate estimates of biomass and forest area for the\nwhole country but the estimates for the sub-areas, e.g. geographical strata or forest types, are less accurate.\nThe accuracy in Stratum 2, forested areas, is nearly the same as for the whole country, because the second-\nphase sampling is densest in this stratum. The errors of biomass estimates in Stratum 1 and 3 are also\nreasonable, 3.9% and 4.6% for the total biomass and 2.2% and 2.4% for the forest area, respectively. The\nerrors in Stratum 4, i.e. mangroves are highest, 7.6% of the total biomass and 2.8% of the forest area. This is\ndue to low sampling intensity and the small size of Stratum 4, as the second-phase sampling is optimized for\nthe whole country.\n\nAs an option, the first-phase sample (clusters in 2-by-2 km grid) can be used in the estimation of forest area if\na more accurate estimate for sub-areas, for example, mangroves, is required. In this case, the land use class\nand forest type are visually interpreted for all the first-phase sample plots by means of high-resolution remote\nsensing imagery. One option is to use Google Earth or other available material. To guarantee accurate and up-\nto-date results, the images must be very recent, not more than 3 years old. In interpreting a land use class for\neach sample plot, same classification should be used as in IPCC Guidelines and the Kenyan LU map (FPP,\n2013) (Figure 1, Table 2).\n\nTable 4.

Compared to other geometric shapes (of plots) of the same size, a circular\nplot has the shortest perimeter, and consequently, the lowest expected number of border trees.\n\nNested circular plots were tested in the IC-FRA pilot inventory in 2013 (Technical report on the Pilot\ninventory, 2016). According to the feedback from the field teams, the circular plot shape was widely accepted\nand considered to be flexible and quick to measure. Because the plot radius is a horizontal distance, use of\nelectronic distance measuring equipment such as Haglof Vertex or TruPulse Rangefinder, are recommended in\nestablishing circular plots.\n\n \n\nFigure 4. Sample plot design for Stratum 2 (forested areas) and Stratum 4 (mangroves).\n\nBecause Stratum 1 (grasslands) and Stratum 3 (coast) are mainly grassland with scattered natural forest\npatches or cropland with trees on farm, a radius of 20 m instead of 15 m for the largest sample plot is\nrecommended (Figure 4). Using this approach, scattered trees, e.g. TOF, will be better captured. On the basis\nof the time consumption data from the IC-FRA pilot inventory, the enlargement will not radically increase the\ntime spent for measurements on a sample plot. On grasslands and croplands there are fewer trees than in\nforests and they are mainly of smaller diameter classes. Thus, the extra 5 m in the outer radius will not\nincrease the amount of trees or time consumption significantly.\n\nThe cumulative plot area in a cluster is 0.424 ha in Strata 2 and 4, and 0.754 ha in Strata 1 and 3, which can be\nregarded as sufficient in tropical forest to capture species composition and diameter distribution of trees.\nPrevious studies have shown that a plot size of approximately 0.35 \u2014 0.5 ha is necessary for estimating\naboveground biomass accurately in tropical forests (Brown et al., 1995; Clark and Clark, 2000).\n\nTree measurements on the concentric sample plots include measurements of both living and dead standing\ntrees and palms. Climbers (lianas), bamboos, lying dead wood, shrubs and stumps are measured from the same\nconcentric sample plots as trees (Table 5). Bamboos are primarily measured by clumps within a sample plot of\n10 m radius but in case bamboos are evenly situated (no groups/clumps), two subplots with a radius of 2 m\nlocated in the west and east in 5 meters distance from the sample plot centre can be used to calculate all\nbamboos. Number of saplings (regeneration) will be recorded from two subplots located at a distance of 10 m\nto the west and east from the sample plot centre. Regeneration subplots are circular with a radius of 2 m\n(Figure 4). The sample plot measurements are described in more detail in the field manual (Appendix 2).\n\n14", "Table 5.

A stand is a connected land area which is homogenous with respect to land use, vegetation\ntype, growing stock and possibly accomplished measures and proposed future management. Stand variables\ninclude, for example, land use and land cover class, past land use class and time of change, damage and\nhuman impact. In addition, observations on biodiversity, erosion, grazing, non-wood forest products and\nservices, and water catchment are recorded. All variables with definitions and classifications are described in\nthe field manual (Appendix 2).\n\n3.3 Soil sampling\n\nTo estimate Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in forests, soil samples from the top 30 cm layer are collected and\ndelivered to soil laboratories for further analyses. In addition, samples of litter and woody debris are collected\nto characterize the relative carbon amount from the above-ground forest ecosystem layer. The soil, litter and\nwoody debris samples are collected from all second-phase clusters that have sample plots in forested areas.\nThe expected number of forested clusters is 2655. In a cluster, samples are taken from as many sample plots in\nthe forested areas as possible in a working day taking into account that the field team should complete a\ncluster a day and leave the cluster together.\n\nIn a sample plot, composite samples of soil, litter and woody debris are collected from 4 subplots located in\nthe cardinal directions 1 m outside the largest concentric circle plot (15 m or 20 m). The subplot for litter and\nwoody debris sampling is a circle of 1 m* area, and volumetric soil samples are taken from a soil pit within a 2\nm x 2 m area close to the theoretical sampling point. Detailed instructions for soil, litter and woody debris\nsampling and assessment of soil characteristics are described in the field manual (Appendix 2).\n\nIn mangroves, soil, litter and woody debris sampling is somewhat different than on uplands. Mangroves are\nexceptional ecosystems and expected to have large carbon stocks in belowground biomass. In tidal conditions,\ndecomposed organic matter and water transported mineral particles accumulate water-saturated and muddy\nsediments. Given the relative small area of mangroves in Kenya, sampling is carried out on all second-phase\nsample plots. Furthermore, sediment samples are collected from layers down to 100 cm. The expected number\nof forested clusters in mangroves is 41, and each cluster consists of 4 sample plots.\n\n15", "4 Laboratory analyses\n\nSoil, litter and woody debris samples collected from the second-phase sample plots will be delivered to soil\nlaboratories for carbon analysis. The expected number of soil samples is approximately 3900 assuming that\nfrom each forested cluster in uplands (2614) soil samples are collected at least from one sample plot and every\nsecond cluster from two sample plots. In mangroves, soil sampling is carried out in each cluster (41) and\nhence, there will be about 60 sediment samples to analyse. Considering the expected number of samples, it is\nrecommended that four soil laboratories around Kenya be engaged in the NFRA soil analyses. The analyses\ntask will be shared regionally taking into account laboratory resources and soil transport costs.\n\nIn the IC-FRA project, an inventory of active soil laboratories in Kenya was conducted to assess their\npotentials in terms of equipment and personnel. On the basis of this assessment, the following laboratories are\nsuggested for analysing soil samples in the NFRA from the regions mentioned:\n\ne KEFRI Gede, the coastal region and mangroves;\n\ne KEFRI Maseno, Western Kenya;\n\ne Uo, Rift valley, central highlands; and\n\ne KEFRI Muguga (Hqgs), central highlands and all other areas.\n\nIn addition to these, an external laboratory, either universities (Jomo Kenyatta, UoE) or ICRAF, should be\ninvolved in Quality Assurance (QA) to control the analyses methods used and accuracy of the results. In\ninternal Quality Control (QC) in the NFRA laboratories, regular cross-checking of same samples is used for\ncalibrating the methods.\n\nIt is recommended that organic carbon content of upland soil samples be determined by means of the Walkey-\nBlack method, which is based on wet combustion with traditional manual analytics. This is to conduct\nanalyses with moderate costs and commonly available laboratory equipment. More sophisticated methods\nbased on dry combustion would require costly and specialized equipment. Because mangrove sediments have\nhigh chloride concentration and are also expected to have very high organic carbon content, instead of the\nWalkey-Black method, the Loss on Ignition (LOD method is recommended for analysing sediment samples.\nThis method is based on burning the organic matter and widely used in OC analyses of organic rich soils and\nmatters, such as manure, compost and sediments. The organic carbon content of litter and woody debris is\nestimated as a proportion of dry biomass.\n\nProcedures for analysing soil and sediment samples in a laboratory is described in the manual for Preparation\nand organic carbon analyses from forest soil and mangrove sediment samples (Appendix 3). Preparatory\nmeasures include stabilization by air drying, oven-drying, weighing, sieving and homogenization. In addition,\nthe manual provides tools for calculating results and for computation, an Excel workbook application\ndeveloped in the IC-FRA pilot inventory is available.\n\n5 Socioeconomic survey\n\nThe socioeconomic survey will provide information on contribution of forest resources to livelihoods of forest\nadjacent households and community interaction with the forests. Socioeconomic data is collected by\ninterviewing households and communities\u2019 key informants. The ultimate objective is to generate information\nabout forest use and needs of local communities to support decision making and improved land use policy at\nnational level.\n\nThe socioeconomic survey should be undertaken simultaneously with the biophysical inventory for synergy\nand logistics in the field work. The recommended sampling design for the socioeconomic survey follows the\ndesign for biophysical measurements for reasons of consistency and credibility. The same sampling design\nprovides an unbiased sample of communities, and the socioeconomic data can be linked with the biophysical\ndata, which in turn enables analytical approach to the interaction between communities and forest goods and\nservices.\n\n16", "Proposed data collection procedures are based on FAO\u2019s guidelines for Integrated Land Use Assessments\n(ILUA) and National Forest Monitoring and Assessment (NFMA) which have been adopted, for example, in\nZambia and Tanzania. Socioeconomic data includes variables describing forest use and users. Content of key\ninformant and household survey questionnaires are described in a sepatate field manual in detail.\n\nSocioeconomic survey will be conducted on 50% of the permanent clusters and 25% of the temporary\nclusters. In each cluster, four households are randomly sampled within 2 kilometre-radius around the cluster\ncentre. In case there are no households available within 2 kilometres, two households are sampled within 4\nkilometres and if still there are no households available, then up to 10 kilometres radius. The survey requires\ncareful preparation before the field work, including sampling of households, identification of key informants,\nselection of local enumerators and interpreters if needed due to language barriers, and sensitization of local\nleaders.\n\nIn the selected clusters, NFRA field teams will include two socioeconomic interviewers. They move to the\nfield together with the rest of the team and have transport available to reach the selected households during the\nday. The interviewers need a GPS for navigating and need training on its use. The survey questionnaires are\nplanned in a way that answers can be easily entered digitally during the interview, if not (while interviewing)\nlater during the same day. Before the field work, interviewers are trained on the survey questionnaires to\nunderstand and to get \u2018meaningful\u2019 answers so as to reduce the time taken in administration, and to increase\naccuracy.\n\n6 Quality Assurance\n\nIt is important to implement Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures at the same time\nwhen establishing a NFRA and monitoring system. As defined in IPCC (2006) Guidelines, QC activities are\ninternal routines and checks to assess and maintain the quality in all phases of the inventory. The QC is\ndesigned to ensure data quality, identify errors and address practices that need to be improved, and to\ndocument and archive all inventory material. QA procedures in turn are external assessments of the quality.\n\nIt is recommended that the quality system of NFRA and monitoring be outlined and documented as a Quality\nhandbook. The Quality handbook should describe NFRA organisation and responsibilities, personnel and their\ncompetence requirements, work safety instructions, NFRA procedures and equipment. The NFRA procedures,\nthat is, key activities in carrying out the NFRA from preparing for the field work to the reporting of the\nresults, are described in detail in separate procedure guidelines. These are to document how the NFRA is\ncarried out and to guarantee that the work in each phase is efficient and coherent. A field manual is an\nexample of such procedure guidelines. The quality system should also include registers of equipment.\n\nIn addition to the high quality in all NFRA work, special QC activities should be conducted in the field work\nand in the laboratory analyses. It is recommended that ca. 5% of the field sample plots are re-measured to\nguarantee data quality. The QC measurements should be carried out by separate QC field teams shortly after\nthe actual measurements to enable quick feedback and corrections in case some errors are detected.\n\n7 Forest monitoring\n\nThe NFRA and forest monitoring is a continuous process and it is suggested that the field inventory will be\ncarried out periodically to provide up-to-date information on forest and tree resources with known accuracy.\nThis is to keep up with international reporting requirements and also produce relevant information to national\ndecision and policy processes. In a monitoring system, capability to produce information on changes in forest\nand tree resources (cover, growth, removal) plays a key role.\n\nThe proposed NFRA field work is scheduled to be carried out in three years and the results will be available in\n\nthe fourth year. The next field inventory could then start by the fifth year. If the second round is carried out\nequally in three years, the first information on changes could be obtained eight years after starting the first\n\n17", "inventory. A feasible cycle, however, depends on the financial resources available. It is recommended that the\nproposed sampling method, and furthermore, the same sampling design be applied also in the future\ninventories. The two-phase sampling method has an advantage that an optimal allocation of the second-phase\nsample can be based on the current situation at each round.\n\nEstablishing sample plots as permanent and re-measuring the same plots in subsequent inventories would\nbenefit in estimation of changes, e.g. in land use and biomass. Permanent plots are more efficient, because\nchanges can be estimated at the plot and tree level, whereas in the case of temporary plots, change estimates\nare based on the difference between the results in subsequent inventories. Permanent plots, however, have\nsome drawbacks that may affect their applicability. For instance, if their existence is known to local people\nand forest managers, trees on the sample plot may be treated differently than otherwise.\n\nThe proposed allocation of the second-phase sample for the first NFRA is based on the current forest cover\n(FPP 2013) and may not capture all areas where changes in land use and biomass are likely to occur, for\nexample afforestation and tree planting on farms. In the allocation, more weight was given to the forested\nclusters but it should be noted that the second-phase sample includes also clusters without any forested plots,\nonly that their number is lower.\n\nIt is recommended that a combination of permanent and temporary plots will be used in the first NFRA round,\nand a quarter (25%) of the second-phase clusters will be established as permanent. The relatively low amount\nof permanent sample plots will allow for more flexible second-phase sampling in the future. In the field,\npermanent sample plots are marked with a metal stick or peg, hidden in the ground to keep the location secret,\nand sample plot coordinates recorded. This is to locate the permanent sample plots for re-measurements.\nHowever, their existence should not impact local forest management or other activities.\n\nIn the allocation of the second-phase sample, the LU map of Kenya (FPP, 2013) based on ALOS AVNIR-2\nand DMC satellite imagery acquired in 2009 \u2014 2011 was used. The ground resolutions of the imagery were 10\nmx 10 mand 22 mx 22 m, respectively. The LU map represents the land use cover in Kenya in 2010. For an\noptimal allocation of the second-phase sample in the next field inventory, similar LU or land cover map is\nrequired. It is proposed that the LU map is updated periodically, for example, in 5-year-intervals to facilitate\nthe allocation. For that purpose, for example, freely available Landsat satellite imagery with a resolution of 30\nm x 30 m would be sufficient. Satellite imagery can also be utilized in assessing drastic changes on the sample\nplots such as deforestation or (clear) felling but not growth or degradation (see e.g. Maniatis & Mollicone,\n2010).\n\n8 Data management and reporting\n\n8.1 Data management software\n\nOpen Foris Software tools developed by FAO are proposed for data management in the NFRA. Open Foris\n(OF) is a set of open, freely available software tools that can be modified for different tasks in forest\nassessment, monitoring and reporting (http://www.openforis.org/). The OF tools are recommended for NFRA\nfield data recording, data management, calculations and reporting. The Open Foris software was used in the\nIC-FRA pilot inventory and the tools modified and further developed to adapt to the Kenyan conditions.\n\nOpen Foris (OF) Collect is recommended for field data collection (data entry and cleansing) and data\nmanagement. OF Collect includes a survey designer for formulation of database and validation rules in the\ndata entry. Mobile Collect is an android App run on a smartphone or PDA and data recorded need to be\nintegrated with OF Collect for data management. Therefore, OF Collect run on a field tablet is recommended\nbecause with OF Collect, the data is entered directly to the database and thus extra data transfers are avoided.\nAs a database, SQLite or PostgreSQL can be used. The workflow in OF Collect is as follows: The field teams\nenter data, fix or confirm data validation and logical errors in the field, and by evening of the same day, export\nthe data to a laptop and submit the data to the central or a cloud server for cleansing. The original data is saved\n\n18", "for backup. In the data cleansing, expert users nominated for the task and working at the office correct or\nremove errors and submit data for analyses.\n\nIn the data analyses, OF Calc software based on R calculation engine is recommended. OF Calc is fully\ncustomizable and enables building of complex data processing chains that are required in calculating country\nlevel results from the sample plot measurements. R in turn is an open-source statistical software and also\nfreely available. OF Calc is designed for both experts and end users. Field data can be imported directly from\nOF Collect to OF Calc. For expert users it is possible to develop the calculation chain, for example, by\nimporting external equations, such as new tree volume and biomass models, and this way continuously\nimprove the accuracy of the results. For end users it is possible to repeat the calculations and look at the\nresults shown as tables, graphs and figures.\n\nAggregated results from OF Calc can be analysed and visualised using the open-source software Saiku. Saiku\nprovides a user-friendly interface to the data and it can be used for exploring and reporting the results for\nmultiple purposes, for example, for REDD+ and GHG reporting to the UNFCCC.\n\n8.2. Data management system\n\nA data management system has to be designed as an early step of establishing the NFRA. The data\nmanagement system should include protocols and documentation for data entry, back-up, data cleansing,\narchival, data analyses and estimation, and reporting. The NFRA data is ideally stored in a central server to\nguarantee data integrity and long-term availability for time series calculations. In addition to hardware,\nsoftware and processes, the data management system should define responsibilities and data sharing policy. It\nmust be clearly defined who can access and modify the data in each step, and who is responsible for each task.\nThis is typically described also in the Quality Handbook, which should include guidelines for all NFRA\nprocesses and an organization structure with responsibilities.\n\nIn the IC-FRA project, the data management was implemented with the Open Foris software as described\nabove. The OF Collect data entry forms and database developed in the IC-FRA are available and can be easily\nmodified if necessary. For the proposed sampling method, i.e. two-phase sampling for stratification, the\nestimation and error estimation tools programmed by R are available in OF Calc.\n\nAs part of the data management system, data sharing policy for the NFRA needs to be agreed up on. The\nsample plot data is sensitive because the plot locations are known. With the help of coordinates the plots can\nbe located and identified in the field and connected with, for example, property owners. This may lead to\nmisuse of the sample plot data concerning, for example, value of the growing stock, rare species or\nbiodiversity hotspots. Especially socioeconomics data must be considered carefully because it includes\npersonal information.\n\nKenyan national legislation and information policy set the guiding principles for data publicity. In Vision\n2030, the strategy for transparency and accountability encourages public access to information and data\n(Kenya, 2007). The NFRA data policy should determine which data can be shared publicly and which are\nrestricted. Generally, aggregated results on forest resources should be public information and easily available\nfor everyone interested, especially to all relevant stakeholders both within the forest sector and across other\nsectors such as agriculture and tourism. Strengthened sharing and dissemination of forest information is best\nachieved through a web-based interphase.\n\nIn contrast, access to the sample plot data with coordinates could be limited to the NFRA staff or analysts\nprocessing the data. Similarly, socioeconomic data should be accessible for specified staff members only.\nHowever, it is recommended that the NFRA raw data can be available for research purposes on request. The\nsample plot data will provide material for various research topics and it can also be used as ground trothing\ndata in RS analyses, for example, in producing forest biomass maps over the country. Because the data has\ncommercial value, a signed agreement determining data ownership and rights of use is recommended when\nsharing the raw data with an external party.\n\n19", "x\nNFRAM Unit NF RAM Management team\n- Manager and assistant manager\n\n/KFS - Heads of thematic responsibilities\n\nWorking groups by thematic responsibilities\n\nCo-operation with Mapping Field Bou Data Research and\nlaboratory management\nDevelopment\n\ndRS inv: \u2018\n\nDRSRS, KE FRI aD Ten analyses and Reporting\n\nand Universities\nGIS expert, Field coordinator, |} Laboratory Database Inventory expert,\n\nRS expert, QC coordinator, focal points, manager, Social-economist,\n\nOfficers Field team leaders Soil technicians Data analysts, Soil scientist,\nOfficers Statistician", "9.2 Organization of field inventory\n\nThis proposal concentrates on the technical implementation of the NFRA and therefore, the structure of the\nkey TWG, i.e. Field inventory, is elaborated further. It should be noted that the organizational structure needs\nto be adapted to the structure of the host institution. Most importantly, the TWGs should work closely together\nand the roles and responsibilities need to be assigned clearly.\n\nThe TWG of Field inventory is responsible for carrying out the sample plot measurements and the\nsocioeconomic survey in the whole country. The TWG should encompass expertise in biophysical\nmeasurements and socioeconomics, and there should be an expert responsible for the field work of each\nsubject separately. TWG\u2019s responsibilities include preparatory activities before the actual field work, such as\nprocurement of field equipment and training of the field teams, and Quality Control (QC) during the field\ninventory. The TWG is also responsible for logistics (acquiring and maintenance of equipment, transportation\nof soil samples from field to the laboratories) and supervision of the field personnel.\n\nThe TWG of Field inventory has common interfaces with the other TWGs, and the division of roles is\nimportant to guarantee efficient operation. Regarding the data collection software, it is recommended that the\nTWG of Data management and reporting will take the responsibility of modifying the field survey forms as\nthis is directly linked to the database management. Regarding the soil sampling and SOC analyses, the TWG\nof Field Inventory should be responsible for the collection and delivery of soil samples to the laboratories and\nthe TWG of Laboratory analyses for the rest, i.e. actual analyses, compiling the results and storing the samples\nas necessary.\n\nGiven the scope of responsibilities and the high number of staff involved in the field work, the TWG of Field\ninventory should have a structure of two levels. The TWG should consist of the persons responsible and their\ndeputies for the whole field work and separately for biophysical measurements, socioeconomic survey, soil\nand sediment sampling and QC. The second level under the TWG should comprise field team leaders and QC\nteam leaders. The persons responsible for biophysical measurements and QC are the contact persons to the\nfield team leaders.\n\nThe proposed sampling design is based on preconditions that there are 15 field teams working in the field.\nEach team will comprise of 10 permanent workers and in addition, one or two local casuals hired to help in\nthe field work (clearing brush on the way, measuring trees, soil sampling, etc.). The recommended\ncomposition of a field team should include:\ne 2 Foresters (one team leader and an assistant team leader);\n1 \u2014 2 Rangers (as needed, when needed for security);\n1 Taxonomist (as needed, when needed);\n2 Soil technicians;\n2 Socio-economic interviewers;\n2 Drivers; and\n1 \u2014 2 Casuals to do biophysical measurements (enumerators).\n\nThe team composition may differ depending on the region and vegetation type. For example, rangers or\ntaxonomist may not be needed in plantations or in farm forests. One of the foresters is nominated as a team\nleader and he or she has the overall responsibility of the team\u2019s work, measurements, data quality, equipment\nand logistics.\n\nTo guarantee data quality, two Quality Control (QC) teams should be established to re-measure about 5% of\nthe sample plots. The QC teams are similar to the actual field teams but slightly smaller. A QC team is\nassumed to move in one vehicle. Soil sampling and socioeconomics survey are not repeated in the QC, and\ntherefore, the QC teams do not include soil technicians or socioeconomic interviewers. In addition, the team\ncomposition should vary between vegetation types as necessary, for example, more rangers and casuals are\nneeded more in natural forests than in plantations.\n\n21", "10 Capacity Building\n\n10.1 Training of field teams\n\nImplementation of the NFRA will require a considerable workforce. The field measurements alone will\nemploy 150 staff members (17 teams, 10 members each); of these 32 should be foresters by profession. In\naddition, 30 soil technicians and 15 taxonomists need to be recruited for the NFRA. Each post in the NFRA\nshould have competence requirements in order to guarantee quality of the work following the competence\nrequirements documented in the NFRA Quality handbook together with the organizational structure. Besides\nprofessional competence, training on specified NFRA tasks will be of the utmost importance.\n\nAltogether three weeks\u2019 training is recommended in the first year before the actual field work. In case new\nworkers are hired during the three years\u2019 inventory period, adequate training has to be organized for them as\nwell. The training should cover all phases of the field work from preparations to the data cleansing. Field team\nmembers are trained on the inventory methods, navigation to the plots (use of GPS), field measurements\n(sample plot, forest and tree measurements, soil sampling), correct use and maintenance of field equipment,\nand data recording (use of field tablet). The training should include both theoretical and practical sessions\nwhere all measurements are practised in the field. Field team members should also be familiarized with\npersonnel issues such as contract of employment (privileges and responsibilities), work safety and practical\narrangements of the field work (travel, time schedules, etc.). After the training, the teams should be able to\ncarry out the field work independently, efficiently and correctly according to the field manual and other\nrelevant instructions.\n\nTaking into account the large number of field staff, training in smaller groups is recommended. It is rational\nthat part of the training is separate e.g. for soil technicians to practise the soil sampling, and for socioeconomic\ninterviewers to learn questionnaire technics. The team leaders need the most comprehensive training as they\nhave overall responsibility of the team\u2019s work. Together with assistant team leaders (another forester in the\nteam) they should also learn to use all technology applied in the field work such as GPS, data recording and\nmanagement with Open Foris tools, and Vertex laser hypsometer. Similarly, supervisors should have the same\nknowledge and it is recommended that in the first year they should be trained thoroughly on how to do the\nfield measurements accurately. The aim is that supervisors and experienced team leaders can be instructors in\nthe future.\n\nThe competence of field team members can be verified after the training, for example, by arranging test\nmeasurements which the teams should qualify. Supervisors can also join the field teams for the first inventory\ndays and ensure that the measurements are carried out correctly. It is recommended that they visit the teams\nalso during the field work for monitoring and motivation. In any case, team leaders are responsible for\ncontrolling and ensuring that the data is collected reliably and the forms filled in properly. If some mistakes\nare detected, feedback and guidance to the field workers is given directly and immediately. Also QC results\nshould be utilized and more emphasis put on training on how to take measurements that cause most\ndifficulties in the field.\n\n10.2 Research and development\n\nImplementation and continuous development of the NFRA require national capacity to ensure sustainability\nand national ownership. The existing human and institutional capacities need to be strengthened and extended\nto cover identified capacity gaps. Research institutions, especially KEFRI and universities need to be engaged\nin the development work, for example, to improve calculation chain by providing new species-specific\nbiomass models. The NFRA will offer good opportunities for students to increase their knowledge and skills\nin forest inventory. To guarantee capacity for NFRA, also in the future, students should be involved in\ndifferent tasks such as field measurements and data management, and in the form of master and doctoral\ntheses in the NFRA research work, for example, on error sources and accuracy of measurements.\n\nIn the IC-FRA project, officers and scientists from four national institutions (KFS, KEFRI, DRSRS and UoE)\nacquired capacity in planning and carrying out forest inventory, including use of modern equipment in field\n\n22", "measurements and capability to calculate results using Open Foris tools. Four field teams and two QC teams\nwere trained for the field work. Soil technicians in KEFRI Muguga acquired capacity in collecting and\nanalysing soil organic carbon samples and reporting the results. In addition, IT personnel were involved in\ninventory data management. Altogether ca. 50 staff members were engaged in the IC-FRA project and they\nacquired capacity required in conducting a NFRA. In addition to increasing the amount of NFRA staff, the\nfollowing capacity gaps were identified and should be further strengthened:\n\nSampling designs, measurements and error estimation;\n\nInventory data analyses, efficient application of the recommended software, especially R;\nData management with Linux Server and Virtual machine and database system;\n\nVolume and biomass models for more tree species;\n\nVolume and biomass models for shrubs and mangroves;\n\nAdequate infrastructure and personnel; and\n\nTimely implementation of work plans, administration and operational management.\n\n11 Budget\n\nThe estimated budget for the first NFRA is 784 million KSh (7.13 million Euros), which includes field work,\nphysical assets required, laboratory analyses, data management and reporting, and management costs during\nthe first field inventory (Table 7). In the budget for field work, daily allowances (DSAs) of field team (15),\nQC team (2) and supervisory team (2) members are included but not the wages. This is the same for the other\nactivities; the wages of permanent staff are not included in the budget. Accordingly, the budget shows\nestimated costs of the NFRA data collection during the first three years but not the cost of establishing a\npermanent NFRA unit and infrastructure.\n\nIt is assumed that the field teams will work for 8 months per year, i.e. there is a break in the field\nmeasurements during the rainy season. According to the sampling design and the objective of measuring one\ncluster per day, 15 teams will be able to accomplish the suggested amount of second-phase clusters\napproximately in 7,000 days which is a little less than three years. If the teams can not measure all the sample\nplots of a cluster during one working day, it is assumed that they overnight in the field. In practice, it is\nrecommended that the field teams be flexible and motived enough to work longer hours if needed to finish one\ncluster per day. Overnighting in the field is recommended only in situations where it takes almost a day to\nreach the sample plot location and there is no point in waking there twice. On the other hand, there will be\nclusters with only few forested plots, which are faster to measure. In these cases the field teams should\ncontinue measurements on another cluster during the same day. The rates applied in the estimation of travel\ncosts are listed in Table 6.\n\nTable 6. Unit cost of NFRA field team members.\n\n \n\n23", "The two QC teams are expected to work 3 months per year and the same rates (Table 6) are applied for the QC\nteam members. In addition, two supervisory teams consisting of two senior foresters each are expected to visit\nthe field teams during the field measurements. The estimated budget includes four 5 days travel per year with\narate of 10,500 KSh for a supervisor.\n\nThe budget for fixed assets includes procurement of required inventory equipment for 15 field teams and 2\nQC teams, laboratory equipment to facilitate organic carbon analyses in four soil laboratories, and vehicles for\nthe field teams (Table 7). A list of inventory equipment required by each team is in the Field Manual\n(Appendix 2), including toughpads and laptops for recording biophysical measurements and socioeconomics\ndata, respectively. In the IC-FRA project, inventory equipment and toughpads were purchased for five field\nteams. These and other existing equipment should be utilized as well. In the field work, equipment wear out\nand extra items are needed for backup.\n\nProcurement of new vehicles for the field teams constitutes a considerable cost in the budget (181 million\nKSh). Half of this amount and part of the running costs could be saved if one field team could move with one\nvehicle. A full team however consists of 12 members if rangers and a taxonomist are included. In addition, 2\nsocioeconomic interviewers need to move independently between households around a cluster during a work\nday. Careful planning of logistics is extremely important because the socioeconomics survey is carried out\nonly on part of the clusters, and a taxonomist or rangers are not needed in all vegetation types. For cost-\nefficiency, a team should use only one vehicle whenever possible.\n\nIn the estimated budget, the share of NFRA data collection and SOC analyses is 747 million KSh (6.79\nmillion Euros) (Table 7). The remaining part of the budget consists of data management and operational\nmanagement costs. It is assumed that 6 skilled IT persons will be hired to help in data cleansing and\ncalculations in the first NFRA round. Enough permanent NFRA staff should be recruited and trained to\nconduct the data analyses and reporting in the future. Costs of further capacity building in data management\nare however not included in this budget.\n\nOperational management of the NFRA will be a major challenge, especially in the first round. A great deal of\nplanning and preparations before the field work is imperative. These include recruiting staff, procurement,\ntraining, extensive communication, creating awareness about the NFRA and contacting local administration\nabout forthcoming field work. The estimated budget for the management includes lump sums for the running\ncosts but again, not staff wages (Table 7).\n\n24", "Table 7.
