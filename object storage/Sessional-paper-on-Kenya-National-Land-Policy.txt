In April 2007, a Draft National Land Policy was adopted\nby stakeholders through a National Symposium. The Seventh Cabinet\nmeeting held on 25\" June, 2009 approved the Draft National Land Policy\nand directed the Minister for Lands to proceed with the preparation of the\nSessional Paper for presentation to Parliament. The Sessional Paper is\nnow ready and this marks a critical milestone in the National Land Policy\nFormulation Process.\n\nThe National Land Policy is based on views and expert opinions collected\nand collated through a structured all-inclusive and consultative process\nthat brought together stakeholders drawn from the pubic, private and civil\nsociety organizations. The broad based process of consultations was\ncarried out around identified thematic areas that formed the nuclei of\nstakeholder engagement and consensus building, and conducted through\nworkshops, seminars, submission of memoranda and topical research\npapers.\n\nThe various sectoral policies and strategic plans that have been developed\nby other Government Ministries and Agencies were consulted to ensure\nthat the Land Policy recommendations are relevant and roundly consistent\nwith other policy standpoints. In a large measure, the Land Policy has\nbenefited from the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Land\nLaw System of Kenya, the Report of the Constitution of Kenya Review\nCommission and the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the\nIllegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land. Further, the Land Policy\nFormulation Process has been informed by the various key Government\nPolicy standpoints including the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the\nEconomic Recovery Strategy Paper for Wealth and Employment Creation\nand the National Environment Management and Coordination Policy.\n\nThis Sessional Paper, therefore, presents the issues and policy\nrecommendations that have been identified, analyzed and agreed upon by\nthe stakeholders. It is a hall mark of the rare sense of dialogue and\ncollaboration between the Government and the Citizenry in tackling,\narguably, the most emotive and culturally sensitive issue in Kenya. In this\nrespect, therefore, the Paper will form the foundation upon which the\nadministrative and legislative framework will be built. This is the\nframework that will drive the critically required land reforms in this\ncountry.\n\nIt is, however, necessary to point out that the act of formulating a National\nLand Policy will not, on its own, bring about the envisaged land reforms.\nThere is need for goodwill and commitment from everyone to ensure a\nsmooth implementation of the reforms. In this regard, participation of all\nstakeholders will continue to be sought and enhanced by encouraging\n\nvii", "regular consultations and dialogue. The Government, on its part, will\nprovide an enabling policy environment through the establishment of\nessential institutions and provision of sufficient financial support.\n\nIn this way, I am confident that we will collectively achieve the vision of\nthe National Land Policy of guiding the country towards efficient,\nsustainable and equitable use of our land resource.\n\n_= Claw\n\nJames Orengo, M.P., E.G.H.\nMINISTER FOR LANDS\n\nviii", "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nKenya has not had a single and clearly defined National Land Policy since\nindependence. This, together with the existence of many land laws, some\nof which are incompatible, has resulted in a complex land management\nand administration system. The land question has manifested itself in\nmany ways such as fragmentation, breakdown in land administration,\ndisparities in land ownership and poverty. This has resulted in\nenvironmental, social, economic and political problems including\ndeterioration in land quality, squatting and landlessness, disinheritance of\nsome groups and individuals, urban squalor, under-utilization and\nabandonment of agricultural land, tenure insecurity and conflict.\n\nTo address these problems, the Government embarked on the formulation\nof a National Land Policy through a widely consultative process with the\naim of producing a policy whose vision is \u201cTo guide the country towards\nefficient, sustainable and equitable use of land for prosperity and\nposterity\u201d. Stakeholders from public, private and civil society contributed\ntowards the policy formulation through thematic groups based\ndiscussions, regional workshops and written submissions. Past initiatives\nsuch as the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Land Law System\nof Kenya, the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission and the\nPresidential Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of\nPublic Land also informed the formulation process.\n\nThis Sessional Paper has thus been formulated to provide an overall\nframework and define the key measures required to address the critical\nissues of land administration, access to land, land use planning, restitution\nof historical injustices, environmental degradation, conflicts, unplanned\nproliferation of informal urban settlements, outdated legal framework,\ninstitutional framework and information management. It also addresses\nconstitutional issues, such as compulsory acquisition and development\ncontrol as well as tenure. It recognizes the need for security of tenure for\nall Kenyans (all socio-economic groups, women, pastoral communities,\ninformal settlement residents and other marginalized groups).\n\nThe Sessional Paper designates all land in Kenya as Public, Community or\nPrivate. Most significantly, it recognizes and protects customary rights to\nland. It also recognizes and protects private land rights and provides for\nderivative rights from all categories of land rights holding.\n\nThrough the Sessional Paper, the government will ensure that all land is\nput into productive use on a sustainable basis by facilitating the\nimplementation of key principles on land use, productivity targets and\nguidelines as well as conservation. It will encourage a multi-sectoral\napproach to land use, provide social, economic and other incentives and\nput in place an enabling environment for investment, agriculture, livestock\ndevelopment and the exploitation of natural resources.\n\nix", "National, regional, urban, peri-urban, spontaneous settlements planning\nprinciples and guidelines will be formulated and implemented in a\ntransparent, accountable, sustainable, comprehensive and participatory\nmanner. To ensure sound and sustainable environmental management of\nland based resources, dealings in such land will be guided by conservation\nand sustainable utilization principles outlined in national environmental\nlaws and policies.\n\nLand administration and management problems will be addressed through\nstreamlining and strengthening surveying and mapping systems,\nadjudication procedures and processes, land registration and allocation\nsystems and land markets. To ensure access to justice in land related\nmatters, land dispute institutions and mechanisms will be streamlined\nthrough the establishment of independent, accountable and democratic\nsystems and mechanisms including Alternative Dispute Management\nregimes.\n\nInefficient and time consuming land information systems have\ncomplicated planning, zoning and overall management of land. The\nGovernment will prepare and implement national guidelines to improve\nthe quality and quantity of land information through computerization at\nboth national and local levels. This will cover all aspects such as\nstandards, geo-referencing, pre-requisites for LIMS, security, intellectual\nproperty rights and land information dissemination and pricing.\n\nLand issues requiring special intervention, such as historical injustices,\nland rights of minority communities (such as hunter-gatherers, forest-\ndwellers and pastoralists) and vulnerable groups will be addressed. The\nrights of these groups will be recognized and protected. Measures will be\ninitiated to identify such groups and ensure their access to land and\nparticipation in decision making over land and land based resources.\n\nThe institutional framework will be reformed to ensure devolution of\npower and authority, participation and representation, justice, equity and\nsustainability. Three institutions will be set up: the National Land\nCommission, the District Land Boards and Community Land Boards.\nDistrict Land Tribunals will also be established, as will be a National Land\nTrust Fund to mobilize finances. Land matters may in addition be referred\nto the land division of the High Court. The Ministry in charge of Lands\nwill continue performing residual roles including policy formulation and\nenforcement, resource mobilization, and monitoring and evaluation.\nImplementation of the Land Policy will require building of in-house\ncapacity to plan, prepare and implement the policy recommendations.", "CHAPTER 1: BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n1.1 The Problem\n\n1. Land is critical to the economic, social, and cultural development of\nKenya. Land was also a key reason for the struggle for independence\nand land issues remain politically sensitive and culturally complex.\n\n2. Kenya does not have a single clearly defined or codified National\nLand Policy. The problems posed by the lack of a policy have been\nexacerbated by the existence of very many land laws, some of which\nare inconsistent and incompatible. The result is a very complex land\nadministration system.\n\n1.2 Vision of the Policy\n\n3. A National Land Policy that will guide the country towards efficient,\nsustainable and equitable use of land for prosperity and posterity.\n\n1.3 Mission of the Policy\n\n4. To promote positive land reforms for the improvement of the\n\nlivelihoods of Kenyans through the establishment of accountable and\ntransparent laws, institutions and systems dealing with land.\n\n1.4 Objectives of the Policy\n\n5. The overall objective of the National Land Policy is to secure rights\nover land and provide for sustainable growth, investment and the\nreduction of poverty in line with the Government's overall\ndevelopment objectives. Specifically the policy shall offer a\nframework of policies and laws designed to ensure the maintenance\nof a system of land administration and management that will\nprovide:\n\n(a) All citizens with the opportunity to access and beneficially\noccupy and use land;\n\n(b) Economically viable, socially equitable and environmentally\nsustainable allocation and use of land;\n\n(c) Efficient, effective and economical operation of land markets;\n\n(d) Efficient and effective utilisation of land and land-based\nresources; and\n\n(e) Efficient and transparent land dispute resolution mechanisms.\n1.5 National Land Policy Formulation Process\n\n6. The National Land Policy Formulation Process had a three tier\nmanagement structure, namely: the Minister, the Steering Committee", "and the Thematic Groups. The management structure was supported\nby a coordinating unit and a technical advisory council.\n\n1.5.1 Land Policy Principles\n7. The formulation of this Policy was guided by the following principles:\n\n(a) Equitable access to land for subsistence, commercial\nproductivity, settlement, and the need to achieve a sustainable\nbalance between these uses;\n\n(b) Intra- and inter- generational equity;\n(c) Gender equity;\n(d) Secure land rights;\n(e) Effective regulation of land development;\n(f) Sustainable land use;\n(g) Access to land information;\n(h) Efficient land management;\nGi) Vibrant land markets; and\n(j) Transparent and good democratic governance of land.\n1.5.2 Guiding Values\n8. The national land policy formulation process was designed to be:\n(a) Consultative;\n(b) Participatory;\n(c) Interactive;\n(d) Inclusive;\n(e) Consensus-based;\n(f) Timely and professional;\n(g) Transparent;\n(h) Gender sensitive;\n(i) Innovative; and\nGj) Cost effective.\n1.5.3 Methodology\n9. This policy was generated from:\n\n(a) The Issues and Recommendations Report produced by the\nThematic Groups comprising of state and non-state actors;\n\n2", "(b) Regional workshops organized in the eight provinces of Kenya to\ncollect views from stakeholders;\n\n(c) Reports documenting past initiatives on land policy reform; and\n(d) Written submissions from individuals, groups and organisations.\n1.5.4 Policy Review\n\n10. The National Land Policy is a living document which comprises an\noverall framework and set of principles to guide sectoral, legislative\nand institutional reforms in land administration and management.\nThere will be need to review this Land Policy every ten years to take\ninto account current and future needs in view of social and economic\ndynamics in the land sector.", "CHAPTER 2: THE LAND QUESTION\n2.1 Country Background\n2.1.1 Geographical Features and Ecological Zones\n\n11. The Republic of Kenya has an area of approximately 582,646 sq. km.\ncomprising 97.8% land and 2.2% water surface. Only 20% of the\nland area can be classified as medium to high potential agricultural\nland and the rest of the land is mainly arid or semi-arid. Forests,\nwoodlands, national reserves and game parks account for ten percent\n(10%) of the land area, i.e. 58,264 sq. km.\n\n12. Topographically, the country may be divided into four distinct\ngeographical and ecological regions or zones with different patterns\nof land use, namely; the coastal plain, the arid low plateau, the\nhighlands and the Lake Victoria basin. The rainfall patterns are\nextremely varied but generally follow these regions, with the Lake\nVictoria basin receiving the heaviest and most consistent rainfall.\n\n2.1.2 Population Patterns\n\n13. Kenya's population according to the 1999 Population Census was 30.4\nmillion with an annual growth rate of 2.9% and is expected to rise to\n55 million by 2050. In terms of demographic characteristics, the\npopulation remains relatively young with 60% being below the age\nof 18 years, and over 51% being female.\n\n14. The decline in population growth rates in the last ten years was as a\nresult of both increased mortality (from 10% in 1995 to 12% in\n2003) and stagnation in fertility levels (from 4.7% in 1995 to 4.9%\nin 2003). Mortality levels remain high as a result of the persistence\nof tropical diseases such as malaria and nutrition deficiency, as well\nas poverty related causes including widespread food shortages in\nmajor parts of the country.\n\n15. More recently, the rapid spread of HIV and AIDS has accelerated\nmortality levels in both urban and rural areas. HIV and AIDS\nprevalence in most parts of the country now stands at about 7% of\nthe adult population. This has led to reduction of gains achieved\nearlier in health standards, life expectancy, mortality and child\nsurvival. It has also retarded productivity levels, increased the\ndependency ratio and put traditional care structures under strain in\nmost parts of the country. Although considerable progress has been\nachieved in controlling this pandemic, mortality due to HIV and\nAIDS is yet to peak.", "2.1.3 Land Use and Population Distribution\n\n16. Approximately seventy five per cent (75%) of the country's population\nlives within the medium to high potential agricultural areas\n(consisting of 20% of the land mass) while the rest of the population\nlives in the vast Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs). One\nconsequence of this is that size and distribution of land vary widely\nas does population density, which ranges from as low as 2 persons\nper sq. km. in the ASALs to a high of over 2000 persons per sq.km.\nin high potential areas.\n\n17. The rural-urban population balance stands at 78% and 22%\nrespectively with the most rapid growth confined to major urban\ncentres and satellite towns. According to the 1999 Population\nCensus, the overall growth rate of Kenya's urban population stands\nat 6% implying a very rapid rural-urban migration pattern. The\ncensus also indicates that absolute poverty in the rural and urban\nareas now stands at 54% and 53% of the population respectively.\n\n18. In the rural areas, the high to medium potential zones are dominated\nby small farm holdings. In some cases, insecure land-tenure systems\nhave led to low investment in land improvement and productivity.\nMany smallholder areas are suffering continuous fragmentation of\nholdings into uneconomic sizes, and farms are getting smaller in the\nhigh rainfall areas and in the drier zones. In addition, many large\nstate farms that used to produce seed and breeding stock have been\nsub-divided and transferred to private ownership. The National\nDevelopment Plan (2002-2008) proposed the formulation of a\nNational Land Use Policy that would facilitate the preparation and\nimplementation of land use plans for all urban and rural areas.\n\n2.2 The Origins of the Land Question\n2.2.1 Political Aspects\n\n19. It was expected that the transfer of power from colonial authorities to\nindigenous elites would lead to fundamental restructuring of the\nlegacy on land. This did not materialise and the result was a general\nre-entrenchment and continuity of colonial land policies, laws and\nadministrative infrastructure. This was because the decolonisation\nprocess represented an adaptive, co-optive and pre-emptive process\nwhich gave the new power elites access to the European economy.\nTherefore, this process:\n\n(a) Had to be moulded, in a way that allowed the settlers to adapt to\nthe changed economic and political situation by identifying new\ncentres of influence that were not overtly political;", "(b) Had to achieve the aim of socialising the new elite into the\ncolonial political, economic and social patterns to ensure that the\nelite was able to rule functionally on an inherited political\nstructure and co-operate with the outgoing rulers; and\n\n(c) Was geared towards preventing the mobilisation of a nationalist\nbase that would be opposed to continuation of colonial policies\nafter independence.\n\n20. Property rights protection was deemed imperative for the conclusion\nof the independence talks held in Lancaster House from 1960 to\n1962. Having worked out an acceptable bargain, the new rulers set\nabout consolidating their power in the new State. The issue of the\nlandless natives proved a thorny one for the new Government,\nprompting it to institute measures to appease the vocal Africans still\nclamouring for the land taken from them. While these measures\nenabled the small holders to become the main driving force behind\nagricultural production, they were however, inadequate to resolve\nthe issue of landlessness.\n\n2.2.2 Economic Aspects\n\n21. The genesis of the land question can be traced to the colonial times\nwhen the objective was to entrench a dominant settler economy\nwhile subjugating the African economy through administrative and\nlegal mechanisms. For example, the process of colonisation\nintroduced an alien concept of property relations in Kenya, where the\nState or the protectorate as a political entity came to own land and\ngrant to property users subsidiary rights. The economies of nearly all\nKenyan communities remain largely dependent on land for\nlivelihoods. Politically the land question is related to the\nadministrative controls of the economy that use land as leverage for\npolitical support.\n\n2.2.3 Legal Aspects\n\n22. Since independence Kenya has had two land tenure systems, namely\nCustomary and statutory land tenure systems operated under the\nfollowing statutes:\n\n(a) Registration of Titles Act (Cap 281);\n\n(b) Government Lands Act (Cap 280);\n\n(c) Land Titles Act (Cap 282);\n\n(d) Registered Land Act (Cap 300);\n\n(e) The Land (Group Representatives) Act (Cap 287);", "(f) The Trust Land Act (Cap 288); and\n(g) Sectional Properties Act No.21 of 1987.\n\n23. The net effect of these tenure systems on land administration was to\nperpetuate a dual system of economic relationships consisting of an\nexport enclave controlled by a small number of European settlers\nand a subsistence periphery operated by a large number of African\npeasantry. The duality was manifest in:\n\n(a) Systems of land tenure based on principles of English property\nlaw on the one hand and a largely neglected regime of customary\nproperty law on the other hand;\n\n(b) A structure of land distribution characterized by large holdings of\nhigh potential land, on the one hand, and highly degraded and\nfragmented small holdings on the other;\n\n(c) An autonomous and producer controlled legal and administrative\nstructure for the management of the European sector, as opposed\nto a coercive and government controlled structure for the African\nareas; and\n\n(d) A policy environment designed to facilitate the development of\nthe European sector of the economy by under-developing its\nAfrican counterpart.\n\n2.3 Contemporary Manifestations and Impacts of the Land Question\n\n24. Several developments in the country have brought the land question\ninto sharp focus. These include:\n\n(a) Rapid population growth in the small farm sector, a systematic\nbreakdown in land administration and land delivery procedures,\ninadequate participation by communities in the governance and\nmanagement of land and natural resources;\n\n(b) Rapid urbanization, general disregard for land use planning\nregulations, and a multiplicity of legal regimes related to land;\n\n(c) Gross disparities in land ownership, gender and _trans-\ngenerational discrimination in succession, transfer of land and\nthe exclusion of women in land decision making processes;\n\n(d) Lack of capacity to gain access to clearly defined, enforceable\nand transferable property rights;\n\n(e) A general deterioration in land productivity in the large farm\nsector; and\n\n(f) Inadequate environmental management and conflicts over land\nand land based resources.\n\n7", "25. These developments have had many impacts and led to low\nproductivity and poverty. These impacts include :\n\n(a) Severe land pressure and fragmentation of land holdings into\nuneconomic units;\n\n(b) Deterioration in land quality due to poor land use practices;\n(c) Unproductive and speculative land hoarding;\n\n(d) Under-utilization and abandonment of agricultural land;\n\n(e) Severe tenure insecurity due to overlapping rights;\n\n(f) Disinheritance of women and vulnerable members of society,\nand biased decisions by land management and dispute resolution\ninstitutions;\n\n(g) Landlessness and the squatter phenomenon;\n\n(h) Uncontrolled development, urban squalor and environmental\npollution;\n\n(ij) Wanton destruction of forests, catchment areas and areas of\nunique biodiversity;\n\n(j) Desertification in the arid and semi-arid lands; and\n(k) Growth of extra legal land administration processes.\n2.4 Land Policy Issues\n\n26. On account of the above factors, immediate, holistic and systematic\npolicy attention to the land question is needed from a historical as\nwell as contemporary context to address the economic, social,\ncultural, governance and political ramifications of the land issue.\n\n27. The National Land Policy addresses the following important issues:\n(a) Constitutional issues;\n(b) Land tenure issues;\n(c) Land use management issues;\n(d) Land administration issues;\n(e) Land issues requiring special intervention;\n(f) Institutional framework; and\n\n(g) Implementation framework.", "CHAPTER 3: THE LAND POLICY FRAMEWORK\n3.1 PHILOSOPHY OF THE NATIONAL LAND POLICY\n\n28. This Land Policy sets out goals and direction for the present and the\nfuture management of land in Kenya. It consists of measures and\nguidelines which the government shall implement to achieve optimal\nutilization and management of land, and from which laws governing\nland administration and management shall be drawn. This Policy and\nits implementation shall be guided by the philosophy outlined in\nParagraph 29 below.\n\n29. Land is not just a commodity that can be traded in the market. It\nrepresents the following multiple values which should be protected\nby both policy and law:\n\n(a) Land is an economic resource that should be managed\nproductively;\n\n(b) Land is a significant resource to which members of society\nshould have equitable access for livelihood;\n\n(c) Land is a finite resource that should be utilized sustainably; and\n\n(d) Land is a cultural heritage which should be conserved for future\ngenerations.\n\n30. Existing policies and laws on land in Kenya pursue economic\nproductivity at the expense of other equally important values.\nAccordingly, these policies and laws have largely neglected the need\nto ensure equity, sustainability and the preservation of culture in the\nutilisation of land.\n\n31. Some of the consequences of these policies and laws are the\ndeprivation of many Kenyans of access to land and the disruption of\nindigenous culture and conservation systems.\n\n32. This Land Policy recognizes the values of economic productivity,\nequity, environmental sustainability and the conservation of culture,\nand seeks to facilitate their protection.\n\n33. It adopts a plural approach, in which different systems of tenure co-\nexist and benefit from equal guarantees of tenure security. The\nrationale for this plural approach is that the equal recognition and\nprotection of all modes of tenure will facilitate the reconciliation and\nrealisation of the critical values which land represents.\n\n3.2 CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\n34. Land is a central category of property in Kenya. It is the principal\nsource of livelihood and material wealth, and invariably carries\n\n9", "cultural significance for many Kenyans. Fundamental issues in the\nPolicy should be anchored in the Constitution. For these reasons,\nland should be treated as a constitutional issue.\n\n35. The current Constitution does not recognize the uniqueness of land and\nlumps it with other categories of property.\n\n36. In an ideal situation, a constitution should set out the broad principles\nfor the governance of land, and establish an efficient and equitable\ninstitutional framework for land ownership, administration and\nmanagement. Land policy reforms are not likely to succeed in the\nabsence of such a sound constitutional framework. Accordingly, land\nreforms should be accompanied by constitutional reforms if they are\nto be effective.\n\n37. The need for land reforms in Kenya largely arises from the failure of\nthe current Constitution to establish an efficient, accountable and\nequitable institutional framework for land ownership, administration\nand management. This failure has resulted in the following:\n\n(a) Centralisation of state responsibility over land matters, with the\neffect that governmental decisions have not been responsive to\nthe citizenry, especially at the local level;\n\n(b) Lack of governmental accountability in land governance leading\nto irregular allocations of public land;\n\n(c) Constitutional protection of private property rights even where\nthey are acquired in an illegitimate manner;\n\n(d) Mass disinheritance of communities and individuals of their land;\n\n(e) Inequitable access to land, particularly for women, children,\nminority groups and persons with disabilities; and\n\n(f) Ineffective regulation of private property rights, as a result of\nwhich unplanned settlements and environmental degradation\nhave become commonplace.\n\n38. The current Constitution does not provide an adequate framework for\nthe fiscal management of land and land based resources, thereby\ncontributing to poor land use, speculation and loss of land based\nrevenue.\n\n39. In order to establish a firm foundation for land policy reform, the\nConstitution should respect the following principles:\n\n(a) Rational allocation of powers and responsibilities to State\ninstitutions;\n\n(b) Transparency and accountability of State institutions;\n\n10", "(c) Participation of the citizenry in decision-making processes on\nland matters;\n\n(d) Security of legitimate rights to land;\n(e) Equitable access to land in the interests of social justice;\n(f) Resolution of genuine historical and current land injustices;\n\n(g) Regulation of the use of all categories of land in the public\ninterest;\n\n(h) Protection of human rights for all, especially the rights of\nwomen, minorities, children and persons with disabilities, with\nrespect to access to and ownership of land rights; and\n\n(i) Sound framework for the fiscal management of land and land\nbased resources to facilitate efficient utilization and equitable\nallocation of land.\n\n40. The Constitution should embrace the constitutional principles outlined\nabove and establish a firm foundation for the implementation of land\npolicy reforms.\n\n41. The Constitution shall provide for the establishment of a National\nLand Commission (NLC) to carry out efficient, equitable and\nsustainable land administration and management.\n\n3.2.1 Regulation of Property Rights\n\n42. In the regulation of property rights, two particular powers of\nGovernment raise fundamental constitutional issues, and have\nneither been exercised effectively nor accountably. These are the\npowers of compulsory acquisition and development control.\n\n43. The exercise of these powers should be based on rationalized land use\nplans and agreed upon public needs established through democratic\nprocesses.\n\n44, The radical title (ultimate ownership) shall be vested in the people of\nKenya collectively as a nation, as communities and as individuals.\nTenure rights shall be derived from that radical title under specific\nlaws.\n\n3.2.1.1 Compulsory Acquisition\n\n45. Compulsory acquisition is the power of the State to extinguish or\nacquire any title or other interest in land for a public purpose, subject\nto prompt payment of compensation, and is provided for in the\ncurrent Constitution. This power is exercised by the Commissioner\nof Lands on behalf of the State. The current Constitution also\npermits a modified form of acquisition in the case of Trust Land\n\n11", "which may be activated by the President or local authorities. This is\nreferred to as \u2018setting apart_.\n\n46. The established procedures for compulsory acquisition are either\nabused or not adhered to leading to irregular acquisitions. In\naddition, the powers of the President and local authorities to set apart\nTrust Land overlap.\n\n47.The Government shall:\n\n(a) Review the law on compulsory acquisition in order to align it\nwith the new categories of land ownership under Section 3.3.1 of\nthis Policy;\n\n(b) Harmonize the institutional framework for compulsory\nacquisition to avoid overlapping mandates;\n\n(c) Establish compulsory acquisition criteria, processes and\nprocedures that are efficient, transparent and accountable;\n\n(d) Institute legal and administrative mechanisms for the exercise of\nthe power of compulsory acquisition by the State through the\nNational Land Commission; and\n\n(e) Confer pre-emptive rights on the original owners or their\nsuccessor in title where the public purpose or interest justifying\nthe compulsory acquisition fails or ceases.\n\n3.2.1.2 Development Control\n\n48. Development control is the power of the State to regulate property\nrights in urban and rural land, and is derived from the State's\nresponsibility to ensure that the use of land promotes the public\ninterest.\n\n49. Development control has not been extensively used to regulate the use\nof land and to ensure sustainability.\n\n50. Development control is exercised by various Government agencies\nwhose activities are uncoordinated with the result that the attendant\nregulatory framework is largely ineffective.\n\n51. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Align the power of development control with the new categories\nof land ownership under Part 3.3.1of this Policy;\n\n(b) Empower all planning authorities in the country to regulate the\nuse of land taking into account the public interest;\n\n(c) Harmonize the institutional framework for development control\nto facilitate coordination;\n\n12", "(d) Establish development control standards, processes and\nprocedures that are efficient, transparent and accountable taking\ninto account International Conventions and national policies\nrelating to the sustainable use of land and the preservation of\nenvironmental values;\n\n(e) Ensure effective enforcement of development control;\n\n(f) Provide safeguards to ensure that development control does not\namount to compulsory acquisition without compensation;\n\n(g) Ensure that the exercise of development control takes into\naccount local practices and community values on land use and\nenvironmental management; and\n\n(h) Ensure effective public participation in the exercise of\ndevelopment control.\n\n3.3 LAND TENURE ISSUES\n\n52. Land tenure refers to the terms and conditions under which rights to\nland and land-based resources are acquired, retained, used, disposed\nof, or transmitted.\n\n53. Existing policies and laws on land have not provided equal protection\nto all categories of land rights.\n\n54. Colonial and post-colonial land administration has undermined\ntraditional resource management institutions, thereby creating\nuncertainty in access, exploitation and control of land and land-based\nresources.\n\n55. Successive governments in Kenya have been poor stewards of\nGovernment Land and Trust land resulting in the irregular and illegal\nallocation of essential public land, and destruction of critical natural\nresources such as forests and water catchment areas.\n\n3.3.1 Categories of Land\n\n56. Land in Kenya is currently designated as government land, trust land\nand private land.\n\n57. This Policy designates all land in Kenya as Public Land, Community\nLand and Private Land.\n\n58. The Government shall enact a \u201cLand Act_ to govern all categories of\nland.\n\n13", "3.3.1.1 Public Land\n\n59. Public land comprises all land that is not private land or community\nland and any other land declared to be public land by an Act of\nParliament.\n\n60. There is currently no system for registering public institutional land.\nTo safeguard such land, a practice emerged under which it was\nregistered in the name of the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of\nFinance.\n\n61. To secure tenure to public land, the Government shall:\n(a) Repeal the Government Land Act (Cap 280);\n\n(b) Identify and keep an inventory of all public land and place it\nunder the National Land Commission (NLC) to hold and manage\nin trust for the people of Kenya;\n\n(c) Rationalize public land holding and use;\n\n(d) Establish an appropriate fiscal management system to discourage\nland speculation and mobilise revenue;\n\n(e) Establish mechanisms for the repossession of any public land\nacquired illegally or irregularly;\n\n(f) Establish participatory and accountable mechanisms for the\nallocation, development and disposal of public land by the NLC;\nand\n\n(g) Establish an appropriate system for registering public\ninstitutional land.\n\n62. The \u201cLand Act_ shall provide, under the National Land Commission,\nfor the establishment of:\n\n(a) The office of Keeper/Recorder of Public Lands who shall prepare\nand maintain a register of public lands and related statistics; and\n\n(b) A Land Titles Tribunal to determine the bona fide ownership of\nland that was previously public or trust land.\n\n3.3.1.2 Community Land\n\n63. Community land refers to land lawfully held, managed and used by a\ngiven community as shall be defined in the \u201cLand Act\".\n\n64. The process of individualization of tenure, that is, land adjudication\nand/or consolidation, the eventual registration of interests in land\nunder the Registered Land Act (Cap 300) and declaration of whole\ndistricts in the pre-independence period as Government land has\naffected customary tenure in two material respects:\n\n14", "(a) Undermining traditional resource management institutions; and\n\n(b) Ignoring customary land rights not deemed to amount to\nownership, such as family interests in land, the rights of\n\u2018strangers_ (for example jodak among the Luo and the ahoi\namong the Kikuyu), and communal rights to clan land (such as\nrights to inkutot land among the Maasai and rights to kaya forests\namong the Mijikenda).\n\n65. In addition, there has been widespread abuse of trust in the context of\nboth the Trust Land Act (Cap 288) and the Land (Group\nRepresentatives) Act (Cap 287). Thus county councils, which are the\ntrustees of Trust land, have in many cases disposed of trust land\nirregularly and illegally. Further, in the case of pastoral\ncommunities, the group representatives entrusted with the\nmanagement of that land have in many cases disposed of group land\nwithout consulting the other members of their groups.\n\n66. To secure community land, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Document and map existing forms of communal tenure, whether\ncustomary or contemporary, rural or urban, in consultation with\nthe affected groups, and incorporate them into broad principles\nthat will facilitate the orderly evolution of community land law;\n\n(b) Repeal the Trust Land Act (Cap 288);\n\n(c) Define, in the \u201cLand Act_, the term \u201ccommunity_ and vest\nownership of community land in the community;\n\n(d) Lay out, in the \u201cLand Act_, a clear framework and procedures\nfor:\n\ni. The recognition, protection and _ registration of\ncommunity rights to land and land based resources taking\ninto account multiple interests of all land users, including\nwomen;\n\nii. Resolving the problem of illegally acquired trust land;\n\niii. Governing the grant to, and regulation of, rights of use to\nmembers;\n\niv. Reversion of former Government land along the Coastal\nregion to community land after planning and alienation of\nland for public usage;\n\nv. Governing community land transactions using\nparticipatory processes;\n\n15", "vi. Accountability of groups, individuals and _ bodies\nentrusted with the management of community land, and\ncommunity participation in the allocation, development\nand disposal of community land;\n\nvii. Incorporating mechanisms for community land\nmanagement and dispute resolution;\n\nviii. Members opting out of the communal arrangements and\nbuying out of non-members;\n\nix. Reviewing and harmonizing the Land (Group\nRepresentatives) Act (Cap 287) with the proposed \u201cLand\nAct_;\n\nx. Setting apart of community land for public use; and\nxi. Vesting fish landing sites to appropriate local institutions.\n\n(e) Invest in capacity building for communal land governance\ninstitutions and facilitate their operations; and\n\n(f) Facilitate flexible and negotiated cross-boundary access among\ncommunities.\n\n3.3.1.3 Private Land\n\n67. Private land refers to land lawfully held, managed and used by an\nindividual or other entity under statutory tenure. Private land is\nderived from the Government Lands Act (Cap 280), the Registration\nof Titles Act (RTA) (Cap 281), the Land Titles Act (LTA) (Cap\n282), Registered Land Act (RLA) (Cap 300), Trust Land Act (Cap\n288), the Indian Transfer of Property Act (ITPA) and the Sectional\nProperties Act (Act No.21 of 1987).\n\n68. In order to rationalize existing systems of private land ownership, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Harmonize existing modes of statutory tenure under the \u201cLand\nAct_;\n\n(b) Ensure that the alienation of private rights to land takes into\naccount legitimate rights, such as the right of spouses and\nchildren;\n\n(c) Ensure that all private land is held on terms that are clearly\nsubordinate to the doctrines of compulsory acquisition and\ndevelopment control;\n\n(d) Ensure that land management in cooperative and company\nowned farms are regulated by law to secure the rights of affiliate\n\n16", "members and safeguard against subdivisions into uneconomical\nland sizes and non-adherence to planning requirements;\n\n(e) Ensure that private land is held, alienable and transmissible\nwithout discrimination on grounds of sex, ethnicity or\ngeographical origin;\n\n(f) Establish appropriate fiscal incentives to encourage optimal\nutilization of private land and discourage land speculation; and\n\n(g) Ensure that all private land reverts to the State to be managed by\nthe NLC on behalf of the people of Kenya, in case the owner dies\nwithout any heirs and in the absence of legally verifiable claims\non the land.\n\n3.3.2 Overall Tenure Principles\n\n69. The principles guiding the acquisition, use and disposal of land rights\nshall include:\n\n(a) The equal recognition and enforcement of land rights arising\nunder all tenure systems;\n\n(b) Non-discrimination in ownership of, and access to land under all\ntenure systems;\n\n(c) The protection and promotion of the multiple values of land; and\n\n(d) The development of fiscal incentives to encourage the efficient\nutilization of land.\n\n3.3.3 Rights of Ownership\n\n70. Rights of ownership refer to the quantity of rights that different tenure\nsystems confer on individuals, groups of individuals and other\nentities. The principal rights of ownership are the right to use, the\nright to dispose of, and the right to exclude others from the land\nowned. The definition and scope of these rights to land differ from\none tenure system to another, depending on policy considerations\nsuch as the need to ensure equity in access to land.\n\n71. The power of individual holders to sell land has often been exercised\nat the expense of persons who hold legitimate rights over the same\nland.\n\n72. Land is a finite resource. Therefore, it is not possible for every person\nto own land.\n\n73. It is often necessary to restrict the rights of ownership to facilitate\nsustainable resource utilization.\n\n17", "74, A key goal of this policy is to facilitate secure access to land, and not\nnecessarily to grant full ownership rights to land to every person.\n\n75. The Government shall facilitate the acquisition of rights of access to\nland.\n\n3.3.3.1 Freehold Tenure\n\n76. Freehold connotes the largest quantity of land rights which the State\ncan grant to an individual. While it confers unlimited rights of use,\nabuse and disposition, it is subject to the regulatory powers of the\nState. In Kenya, such interests are held under the Registration of\nTitles Act (Cap 281), the Land Titles Act (Cap 282) or the\nGovernment Lands Act (Cap 280). A similar quantity of land rights\nis conferred by the \u2018absolute proprietorship,_ which was introduced\nby the Registered Land Act (Cap 300).\n\n771. The dual existence of the freehold and the absolute proprietorship\n\ncauses confusion. There is no need to continue these two separate\nclassifications of what is essentially the same quantity of land rights.\n\n78. To address and streamline freehold tenure, the Government shall:\n(a) Review and rationalize existing laws on freehold tenure,\nincluding:\ni. Rationalizing freehold tenure and absolute proprietorship;\nand\n\nii. Reviewing the principle of absolute sanctity of first\nregistration under the Registered Land Act to ensure that\nit only protects land rights that have been acquired in a\nlegal and legitimate manner;\n\n(b) Regulate the power of the primary rights holder to dispose of\nland in order to ensure that such disposal takes into account\nlegitimate rights such as family rights.\n\n3.3.3.2 Leasehold Tenure\n\n79. Leasehold tenure is the right to use land for a defined period of time in\nexchange for the performance of certain obligations such as the\npayment of rent. Leasehold rights provide a flexible mechanism for\ntransacting rights in land and for land use control.\n\n80. To facilitate the exercise of leasehold rights, the Government shall:\n(a) Align all leases to this policy;\n\n(b) Establish mechanisms for the creation of leasehold interests out\nof public, community and private land;\n\n18", "(c) Ensure that the duration of all leases does not exceed 99 years\nbut is nevertheless sufficient to encourage long-term investments\nin land;\n\n(d) Establish appropriate mechanisms for the surrender of interests\ncurrently held beyond 99 years in exchange for the proposed\nleasehold term;\n\n(e) Subject the renewal of all leases to general planning\nrequirements; and\n\n(f) Encourage the use of leasehold rights to facilitate concurrent,\nmultiple and shared access to land.\n\n3.3.3.3 Access to Rights of Ownership\n\n81. Access to land in Kenya may be achieved through any one or a\ncombination of the following:\n\nAllocation of public land in rural and urban areas\n\n82. The Government Lands Act (Cap 280) and Trust Lands Act (Cap 288)\nset out procedures for the allocation of public land. In practice, these\nprocedures have been routinely ignored by public officers, resulting\nin irregular and illegal allocation of public land in total disregard of\nthe public interest.\n\n83. Land allocation should principally be for investment, social\ninfrastructure and human settlement. The land for these uses will be\nderived from Public Land and Community Land.\n\n84. To address allocation of public land the Government shall:\n\n(a) Assess the state of landlessness and develop a_ suitable\nprogramme to address it;\n\n(b) Limit the amount of public land allocated to individuals or other\nentities depending on factors such as the intended use and the\necological zone; and\n\n(c) Eliminate incidents of multiple allocations and allocate land\nthrough public auctions except for land earmarked for the\nsupport of livelihoods in urban and rural areas.\n\nLand adjudication\n\n85. Historically, the processes and procedures of land adjudication and\nconsolidation were intended to extinguish customary tenure and\nreplace it with statutory tenure. The implementation of the processes\nof adjudication and consolidation has been slow due to legislative\nand institutional constraints.\n\n19", "86. The Government shall:\n(a) Complete on-going processes of adjudication and consolidation;\n\n(b) Ensure that future adjudication and consolidation processes\nadhere to this Policy; and\n\n(c) Ensure that adjudication and consolidation processes are speedy,\ntransparent and accountable.\n\nLand market operations\n\n87. Land markets deal with the value, transfer, lease, and mortgage of\ninterests in land. Efficient land markets can facilitate access to land.\n\n88. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Facilitate the commercialisation of land rights subject to\nprinciples of equity, sustainability and public policy\nconsiderations such as security;\n\n(b) Develop structures and instruments that will make the land\nmarket operations more efficient and effective, including\nstreamlining existing land transaction procedures.\n\nInheritance of Land\n\n89. Land rights can be acquired through inheritance, which entails testate\nor intestate succession.\n\n90. The Law of Succession Act was supposed to harmonize succession\nsystems but in practice the transmission of land rights is largely done\nwithin customary and religious systems, which discriminate against\nwomen and children.\n\n91. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Sensitize and educate Kenyans on the provisions of the Law of\nSuccession Act;\n\n(b) Expedite the application of the Law of Succession Act; and\n\n(c) Require that all Kenya Gazette notices pertaining to Succession\ncases be posted at the lowest local administrative level and at\nmarket centres.\n\n3.3.3.4 Access to Land by Non-Citizens\n\n92. Under existing land laws, non-citizens can apply for and be allocated\nland for any permissible use. This differs from the practice in some\ncountries where ownership of land by non-citizens is restricted.\n\n93. To ensure that the grant of land rights to non-citizens does not unduly\ndeny citizens access to land, the Government shall:\n\n20", "(a) Prohibit non-citizens from holding freehold interests in land;\n\n(b) Allow non-citizens and foreign companies to acquire leasehold\ninterests only, subject to public policy considerations such as\nsecurity; and\n\n(c) Ensure that the leasehold term for land leased to non-citizens\nshall based on intended use but shall not in any event exceed 99\nyears.\n\n3.3.3.5 Access to Land for Investment\n\n94. Investments in land related ventures are important avenues for creating\nwealth that this Policy intends to promote and develop. To secure the\nnational interest and confer benefits to local communities, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Ensure that the acquisition of land for investment purposes is in\naccordance with national development objectives;\n\n(b) Compulsorily acquire all land on which mineral resources have\nbeen discovered before allocating such land to interested\ninvestors in order to facilitate fast access to the land and to\nprevent the exploitation of local communities, environmental\ndegradation and ensure restoration of land after exploitation;\n\n(c) Regulate the development of private resort cities and other major\nventures to ensure they adhere to development planning and\ncontrol and facilitate public access thereto;\n\n(d) Acquire land for strategic public ventures such as sea ports,\nairports, and research facilities for purposes of security and\nplanning and ensure that such land is accessible to auxiliary\ndevelopers only through sub-leases;\n\n(e) Create land banks for investment in industry and housing\nprogrammes to be availed at prevailing market rates after\nservicing;\n\n(f) Set aside serviced land for housing development for the poor at\naffordable rates; and\n\n(g) Establish a framework for auditing all land based local and\nforeign investment proposals to ensure that they are aligned with\nnational food security needs and protect the land rights of\nindigenous people and communities.\n\n3.3.4 Resource Tenure Policy\n\n95. Kenya is endowed with diverse land based natural resources, which\ncontribute directly or indirectly to the socio-economic well being of\n\n21", "its people. These resources include wildlife, forests, water, minerals,\nmarine, and the land itself. Other resources include biodiversity,\ncultural heritage, palaeontology, archaeology, and indigenous\nknowledge. Sustainable management of these natural resources\ndepends in large part on the governance systems, which define the\nrelationship between people and the resources.\n\n96. To secure access to land based natural resources the Government shall:\n\n(a) Undertake an inventory of all natural resources both exploited\nand unexploited;\n\n(b) Develop a comprehensive resource tenure policy as part of an\noverall land use policy;\n\n(c) Vest renewable resources such as wildlife, water and public\nforests in the State to hold in trust for the people of Kenya;\n\n(d) Vest all non-renewable resources such as minerals, mineral oils\nand gas in the State to hold in trust for the people of Kenya;\n\n(e) Establish legislative and administrative mechanisms for defining\nthe obligations of the State as a trustee for land \u201cbased natural\nresources and determining beneficiaries thereof and _ their\nrespective rights;\n\n(f) Align, to the greatest extent possible, tenure to land based natural\nresources to the different land categories namely public,\ncommunity and private. Where ownership of land-based natural\nresources are vested in a private entity or community, it shall\nensure that they are managed sustainably;\n\n(g) Ensure formal recognition of traditional knowledge related to\nland-based resources and provide the infrastructure for its\ndevelopment and use;\n\n(h) Facilitate public access to beaches, lakes, rivers and fish landing\nsites unless restricted due to environmental fragility or due to\nsecurity reasons;\n\n(i) Provide incentives for communities and individuals to invest in\nincome generating resource conservation programmes; and\n\n(j) Recognize and protect the rights of forest, water dependent or\nother natural resources dependent communities and facilitate\ntheir access, co-management and derivation of benefits from the\nresources.\n\n22", "3.3.4.1 Benefit-Sharing from Land \u2014 Based Natural Resources\n\n97. Sustainable use and sharing of benefits from land based natural\nresources is a concept that has gained popularity in Kenya and\nglobally. Communities and individuals are increasingly becoming\naware of their rights to access and use natural resources within their\nenvirons, as well as participate in the conservation and management\nof such resources.\n\n98. Benefit-sharing is a way of integrating the economic, social and\nenvironmental considerations of land activities.\n\n99. Strategies for sharing benefits should be developed taking into account\nthe nature of the resources involved and the contribution that diverse\nactors make to the management of the resources.\n\n100. To protect community and individual interests over land based\nresources and facilitate benefit sharing, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Establish legal frameworks to recognise community and private\nrights over renewable and non-renewable land-based natural\nresources and incorporate procedures for access to and\nsustainable use of these resources by communities and private\nentities;\n\n(b) Devise and implement participatory mechanisms for\ncompensation for:\n\n1. Loss of land and related non-renewable natural resources;\n\nii. Loss of land where this is deemed important in the public\ninterest for the sustainable management of renewable\nnatural resources; and\n\niii. Damage occasioned by wild animals;\n\n(c) Put in place legislative and administrative mechanisms for\ndetermining and sharing of benefits emanating from land based\nnatural resources by communities and individuals where\napplicable;\n\n(d) Make benefit-sharing mandatory where land based resources of\ncommunities and individuals are managed by national authorities\nfor posterity; and\n\n(e) Ensure the management and utilization of land-based natural\nresources involves all stakeholders.\n\n3.4 LAND USE MANAGEMENT ISSUES\n\n101. The use of land in urban and rural areas as well as in the land/water\ninterface has been a major area of concern to all Kenyans. Problems\n\n23", "of rapid urbanization, inadequate land use planning, unsustainable\nproduction, poor environmental management, inappropriate\necosystem protection and management are commonplace and require\nappropriate policy responses.\n\n102. The government shall put in place appropriate strategies for managing\nsustainable growth and development of urban and rural areas.\n\n3.4.1 Land Use Planning Principles\n\n103. It is recognized that land use planning is essential to the efficient and\nsustainable utilization and management of land and land based\nresources. However, little effort has been made to ensure that such\nplans are effectively prepared and implemented. This has been\nlargely due to the glaring functional disconnect between the plan\npreparatory authorities and implementing agencies, lack of\nappropriate technical and institutional capacity of local authorities,\ninadequate human resource establishment in the ministry responsible\nfor physical planning, absence of broad based consultation and the\nlack of an effective coordinating framework for preparation and\nimplementation of the planning proposals and regulations. Lack of a\nnational land use framework has made the situation worse. These\nproblems manifest themselves in terms of unmitigated urban sprawl,\nland use conflicts, environmental degradation, and spread of slum\ndevelopments and low levels of land utilization among others.\n\n104. Key Issues that need to be addressed in land use planning are:\n\n(a) Preparation of land use plans at national, regional and local\nlevels on the basis of predetermined goals and integrating rural\nand urban development;\n\n(b) Review and harmonization of existing land use planning laws;\n\n(c) Actualization of spatial frameworks for orderly management of\nhuman activities to ensure that such activities are carried out\ntaking into account considerations such as the economy, safety,\naesthetics, harmony in land use and environmental sustainability;\n\n(d) Review of strategies for human settlement in relation to service\ncentres, growth centres, transport and communication network,\nenvironmental conservation and rural development;\n\n(e) Efficient and sustainable utilization and management of land and\nland based resources;\n\n(f) Establishment of an appropriate framework for public\nparticipation in the development of land use and spatial plans;\nand\n\n24", "(g) Establishment of an effective framework for coordination of land\nuse plans to ensure implementation of the planning proposals and\nregulations.\n\n105. To address land use planning issues, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Review and harmonize the Physical Planning Act (Cap 286)\nand Local Government Act (Cap 265), and other relevant\nlegislation;\n\n(b) Develop a national land use policy as a basis for land use\nmanagement;\n\n(c) Provide an appropriate framework for preparation and\nimplementation of national, regional and local area land use\nplans and ensure that the planning process is integrated,\nparticipatory and meets stakeholder needs; and\n\n(d) Facilitate appropriate institutional and technical capacity\n\nbuilding initiatives for accelerating plan implementation at\nnational, regional and local levels.\n\n3.4.1.1 National and Regional Planning\n106. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Facilitate the development of national and regional physical\ndevelopment plans as a basis for investment and sustainable\nutilisation of natural resources, taking local land use practices\ninto account;\n\n(b) Provide for implementation of cluster settlements for easier\nprovision of infrastructure and to stop uncontrolled subdivision\nof land; and\n\n(c) Identify and map areas which are prone to natural calamities\nsuch as floods, landslides and droughts, for national disaster\npreparedness.\n\n3.4.1.2 Rural Land Use Planning\n107. To secure effective rural land use planning, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Review the current laws related to planning to provide for rural\nland use planning;\n\n(b) Recognize rural settlement planning as a tool for sustainable\nresource management, alignment of infrastructure standards and\nprovision of public sites;\n\n(c) Provide for rural land use strategies to assist communities\nachieve optimum productivity; and\n\n25", "(d) Make rural land use planning an integral part of land\nadjudication process.\n\n3.4.1.3 Urban and Peri-Urban Land Use Planning\n\n108. Development of land in urban and peri-urban areas has been inhibited\nby poor planning, rapid growth of human settlements and activities,\nunmitigated urban sprawl and inadequate provision of infrastructure.\nProper planning will facilitate coordinated development of urban and\nperi-urban areas in terms of housing, commercial, industrial and\ninfrastructure development to accommodate changes in lifestyle and\neconomic activities.\n\n109. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Facilitate the preparation and implementation of local area\ndevelopment plans for all urban and peri-urban areas in the\ncountry in a participatory manner;\n\n(b) Establish an effective coordinating mechanism for the\npreparation, implementation of plans and development control;\nand\n\n(c) Encourage development of underutilised land within urban areas.\n3.4.1.4 Planning for Urban Agriculture and Forestry\n110. Urban agriculture has not been properly regulated and facilitated.\n\n111. The following principles shall be implemented to provide a\nframework for the proper carrying out of urban agriculture and\nforestry:\n\n(a) Promotion of multi-functional urban land use; and\n\n(b) Putting in place an appropriate legal framework to facilitate and\nregulate urban agriculture and forestry.\n\n3.4.1.5 Planning for Informal Sector Activities\n\n112. Informal sector activities are a key feature in many parts of Kenya\nboth in planned and unplanned areas and form a crucial part of the\neconomy as a source of livelihood.\n\n113. Informal sector activities have not been accommodated in the\nplanning of urban and rural areas. Informal sector activities have\narisen spontaneously as a result of rural-urban migration without\ncorresponding availability of formal employment opportunities and\nother income generating activities.\n\n26", "114. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Facilitate the provision of land and land use planning to enable\nthe development of informal commercial activities in a more\nordered and sustainable manner;\n\n(b) Put in place mechanisms to allow for informal activities in\nplanned areas;\n\n(c) Designate areas where informal activities can be carried out; and\n\n(d) Institute mechanisms to manage rural-urban migration such as\ndecentralizing development to rural areas and minor urban areas.\n\n3.4.1.6 Regulating Use and Development of Land\n\n115. The key to effective land use planning lies in the existence of requisite\ninstitutional capacity and governance structures for judicious\nimplementation and enforcement of approved plans, policies and\nstrategies.\n\n116. Problems associated with development control include:\n(a) Weak and inadequate institutional capacity;\n\n(b) Lack of harmony among the principal statutes that govern\nplanning and enforcement;\n\n(c) Outdated planning standards and regulations;\n\n(d) The absence of a coordinating framework between and amongst\nthe public sector agencies and the private sector; and\n\n(e) A disconnect between plan preparation, implementation and\ndevelopment control.\n\n117. To ensure that land use plans are applied as tools for effective land\nuse management, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Review planning and development control legislation to\nharmonize the governance structures, decision-making processes,\nplanning standards and regulations;\n\n(b) Enhance institutional and human resource capacity of planning\ninstitutions;\n\n(c) Provide a coordinated framework for enforcing planning\ndecisions;\n\n(d) Establish effective and transparent mechanisms to resolve\nplanning and development control disputes; and\n\n27", "(e) Develop effective legal and administrative mechanisms for the\nregulation of developments in freeholds in gazetted and planned\nurban areas.\n\n3.4.2 Sustainable Production Principles\n\n118. Sustainable land use practices are key to the provision of food security\nand attainment of food self sufficiency. Key problems that need to be\nresolved at the level of policy and law include:\n\n(a) Underutilisation of land particularly in large farms;\n\n(b) Land deterioration due to population pressure, massive soil\nerosion and variability in climatic patterns among other things;\n\n(c) Abandonment of agricultural activities due to poor infrastructure;\n\n(d) Emergence of land use conflicts as a result of competing land\nuses;\n\n(e) Uncontrolled subdivision of land;\n(f) Indiscriminate sale and purchase of land;\n(g) Overstocking in rangelands; and\n\n(h) Lack of alternative innovative land uses and planning for\ndiversification of the rural economy.\n\n119. The Government shall ensure that all land is put into productive use\non a sustainable basis by facilitating the implementation of key land\npolicy principles on conservation of land quality, environmental\naudit and assessment, productivity targets and guidelines, land sizes\nand land use planning.\n\n3.4.2.1 Productivity Targets and Principles\n\n120. Land is needed for food production and for the support of economic\nactivities in all sectors. Good agricultural land continues to be\nconverted to other non-agricultural uses thereby threatening the\ncountry s productive capacity and long term food security. Large\ntracts of land remain underutilized. The following principles\nregarding land productivity targets and guidelines shall be\nimplemented:\n\n(a) Provision of appropriate incentives and sanctions to ensure that\nland owners use their land productively and sustainably;\n\n(b) Putting in place an enabling environment for agriculture and\nlivestock development as well as other uses, including research,\nextension services, finance and infrastructure, marketing, agro-\nprocessing, rural electrification and training of farmers;\n\n28", "(c) Establishing a legal framework for periodic reviews of land use\npractices to facilitate the re-organisation of rural settlements and\ncontrol excessive parcellation into uneconomic units;\n\n(d) Putting in place measures to determine appropriate land sizes\naccording to use and productivity of land;\n\n(e) Putting in place appropriate measures that will enhance both\nlarge scale and small scale production of food for the\nmaintenance of food security in the country;\n\n(f) Provide incentives to stimulate voluntary readjustment of land\nSIZES;\n\n(g) Institute a regulatory framework for land rental markets to spur\ndevelopment of rural agricultural land; and\n\n(h) Review and provide for laws that encourage shared\nproprietorship, time sharing of land and property as opposed to\nindividual ownership only.\n\n3.4.2.2 Land Sizes\n\n121. Population growth and the demand for land have resulted in excessive\nfragmentation of land into uneconomic units. At the same time, a\nnumber of people own large tracts of land which are not utilized\noptimally.\n\n122. The Government shall ensure that all sub-divisions of land are tied to\nland use sizes specified for different ecological zones. To facilitate\nthe attainment of this objective, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Put in place a system to determine economically viable minimum\nland sizes for various zones; and\n\n(b) Promote conformity of land subdivisions with the set minimum\neconomically viable land sizes.\n\n123. To ensure that all land is utilized productively, the Government shall\nperiodically commission field surveys on land holdings to determine\nlevels of utilization with a view to ensuring that the use is economic\nand optimal.\n\n3.4.2.3 Restoration and Conservation of Land Quality\n\n124.To restore the environmental integrity of land and facilitate\nsustainable management of land based resources, the Government\nshall:\n\n(a) Introduce incentives to encourage the use of technology and\nscientific methods for soil conservation;\n\n29", "(b) Encourage use of traditional land conservation methods;\n\n(c) Establish measures to control degradation of land through abuse\nof inputs and inappropriate land use practices; and\n\n(d) Establish institutional mechanisms for conservation of quality of\nland for environmental conservation purposes.\n\n3.4.2.4 Land Reclamation\n\n125. Land reclamation is the process of extending or improving land to\nsupport a specified end use. It is useful in dealing with land that has\nbeen affected by the extraction and processing of non-renewable\nresources, degraded environments, swampy and _ seasonally\nsubmerged wetlands, and the shoreline of the sea or ocean.\n\n126. The purpose of reclamation is to make land suitable for agriculture,\nsettlement or other planned uses.\n\n127. To ensure sustainable utilisation of reclaimed land the Government\nshall develop a regulatory framework for reclamation, rehabilitation,\nrestoration and use of such land.\n\n3.4.3 Environmental Management Principles\n\n128. Kenya faces a number of environmental problems including the\ndegradation of natural resources such as forests, wildlife, water,\nmarine and coastal resources as well as soil erosion and the pollution\nof air, water and land.\n\n129. To conserve and manage the environment, measures on conservation\nand sustainable management, ecosystem protection, urban\nenvironment management, environmental assessment and audits,\nshall be undertaken.\n\n3.4.3.1 Conservation and Sustainable Management of Land Based\nNatural Resources\n\n130. Sustainable management of land based natural resources depends in\nlarge part on the governance systems, which define the relationship\nbetween people, and between people and the resources.\n\n131.To achieve an integrated and comprehensive approach to the\nmanagement of land based natural resources, all policies, regulations\nand laws dealing with these resources shall be harmonised with the\nframework established by the Environmental Management and\nCoordination Act (EMCA), 1999.\n\n132. To manage these resources sustainably, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Facilitate the preparation of participatory environmental action\nplans by communities and _ individuals living near\n\n30", "environmentally sensitive areas in order to take into account\ncultural and socio economic ;\n\n(b) Identify, map and gazette critical wildlife migration and dispersal\nareas and corridors in consultation with the local communities\nand individual land owners;\n\n(c) Encourage the development of wildlife sanctuaries and\nconservancies and involve local communities and individuals\nliving contiguous to the parks and protected areas in the co-\nmanagement of such areas;\n\n(d) Provide mechanisms for resolving grievances arising from\nhuman/wildlife conflicts;\n\n(e) Review the gazettement of forests and protected areas to foster\nthe realisation of their multiple values and ensure that they are\nprotected for their ecosystem values and not merely to\nphysically exclude human activities;\n\n(f) Create an effective institutional framework and capacity to\nimplement International Conventions especially those touching\non access to land based natural resources; and\n\n(g) Facilitate partnership with neighbouring countries to foster\nTrans-Boundary Natural Resource Management (TBNRM) in the\ninterest of national, regional and international conservation and\ndevelopment goals.\n\n3.4.3.2 Ecosystem Protection and Management Principles\n\n133. Kenya has diverse ecosystems which include forests, wetlands marine\nand coastal ecosystems, national parks, arid and semi arid lands\n(ASALs), watersheds, lakes and drainage basins. The trans-boundary\nnature of these resources presents a formidable management\nchallenge because of factors such as conflicting uses and varied\ngovernance frameworks. These factors lead to unsustainable\nexploitation of resources. In addition the problem of unsustainable\nexploitation of resources is exacerbated by inadequate enforcement\nof natural resource management guidelines.\n\n134.To ensure the protection of ecosystems and their sustainable\nmanagement, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Undertake a survey of all critical ecosystems to determine their\nsustainable land uses;\n\n(b) Establish measures to ensure that healthy ecosystems are\nprotected through land use controls; and\n\n31", "(c) Define and maintain beaches at high and low water marks and\nput in place measures to control beach erosion.\n\n135. Fragile ecosystems shall be managed and protected using the\nfollowing measures:\n\n(a) Developing a comprehensive and integrated land use policy\nhaving regard to fragile areas and the needs of neighbouring\ncommunities and individuals in such areas;\n\n(b) Zoning forest land comprising water catchment areas to protect it\nfrom further degradation;\n\n(c) Developing procedures for co-management and rehabilitation of\nforest resources, recognizing traditional management systems\nand sharing of benefits with contiguous communities and\nindividuals;\n\n(d) Establishing participatory mechanisms for sustainable\nmanagement of fragile ecosystems in partnership with public,\nprivate and community stakeholders; and\n\n(e) Declaring all national parks, game reserves, islands, front row\nbeaches and all areas hosting threatened biodiversity as fragile\necosystems.\n\n136. The Government shall ensure that development activities in all islands\nand front row beaches take into account concerns of public access to\nbeaches, the fragility of the ecosystem and national security, and\nsubject such activities to strict controls and management orders.\n\n137. The protection of watersheds, lakes, drainage basins and wetlands\nshall be guided by the following principles:\n\n(a) Prohibition of settlement and agricultural activities in the water\ncatchment areas;\n\n(b) Identification, delineation and gazettement of all water courses\nand wetlands in line with International Conventions; and\n\n(c) Integrated resource management based on ecosystem structures\nregardless of administrative or political boundaries.\n\n138. The Government shall ensure that all land uses and practices conform\nto land use plans and the principles of biodiversity protection,\nconservation and sustainable development.\n\n3.4.3.3 Urban Environmental Management Principles\n\n139. Kenya's rapid urbanization has infringed on environmentally sensitive\nareas such as wetlands, hilltops, water bodies and the coastline. Poor\n\n32", "management of solid and liquid waste, gaseous emissions and unsafe\nquarries are some of the common urban environmental problems.\n\n140. To address urban environmental problems the following measures\nshall be implemented:\n\n(a) Prohibit discharge of untreated solid and liquid waste into rivers,\nlakes and the ocean by providing appropriate waste management\nmethods;\n\n(b) Encourage and require waste segregation and labelling for easier\nmanagement;\n\n(c) Regulate all quarrying and excavation activities;\n(d) Encourage urban waste re-use and recycling; and\n\n(ec) Develop a framework for rehabilitation of dumping sites and\nland that has been subjected to environmental degradation.\n\n3.4.3.4 Environmental Assessment and Audit as Land Management\nTools\n\n141. To promote environmental impact assessment and audit as tools for\nland management, the Government shall implement the following\nprinciples:\n\n(a) Ensure that environmental impact assessments and audits are\ncarried out on all proposed projects, programmes and activities\non land that have a likelihood to degrade the environment;\n\n(b) Monitor urban and rural environmental degradation regularly;\n\n(c) Encourage public participation in the monitoring and protection\nof the environment; and\n(d) Institute enforcement mechanisms such as the \u2018polluter pays\n\nprinciple_, and provide incentives to promote cleaner production\nand prevent pollution of soil, water and air.\n\n3.4.4 Sectoral and Cross-Sectoral Land Use\n\n142. Effective land management requires coordination and cooperation\namong different sectors. This Policy should be understood and\nimplemented taking into account all related sectors such as\nagriculture, livestock, water, energy, human settlement, industry,\ntourism, wildlife, forestry and fisheries.\n\n143.To achieve this objective of effective land management, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Facilitate an integrated and multi-sectoral approach to land use;\n\n33", "(b) Formulate a clear land use policy to guide rural and urban\ndevelopment, avoid land use conflicts and spur productivity;\n\n(c) Encourage integrated land use planning through the use of\nappropriate information technology and participatory processes;\n\n(d) Identify areas of interest for sharing/merging resources and\nexpertise through Public-Private Partnerships;\n\n(e) Ensure that all public and private institutions whose functions are\nassociated with land are involved in the implementation of this\nPolicy;\n\n(f) Align the land use provisions of the Local Government Act (Cap\n265), the Physical Planning Act (Cap 286) and other relevant\nlaws with this Policy; and\n\n(g) Rationalize and harmonize all relevant sectoral policies touching\non land with this Policy.\n\n3.5 LAND ADMINISTRATION ISSUES\n\n144. Land administration refers to the process of determining, recording\nand disseminating information about ownership, value and use of\nland. An efficient land administration system guarantees the\nrecording of land rights, promotes tenure security, and guides land\ntransactions. Further, it provides land users with appropriate forms\nof documentation to guarantee land rights, and supports the\nprocesses of land allocation, land dispute resolution and_ fiscal\nmanagement of land.\n\n145. The principal functions of land administration are:\n(a) Ascertainment and registration of land rights;\n(b) Allocation and management of land;\n(c) Facilitation of efficient transactions in land;\n(d) Development and maintenance of an efficient and accurate land\ninformation system;\n\n(e) Establishment of mechanisms for the assessment of land\nresources for fiscal management and revenue collection; and\n\n(f) Establishment of efficient and accessible mechanisms for\nresolving land disputes.\n\n146. However, the existing land administration system has not performed\nthese functions adequately. It is bureaucratic, expensive,\n\n34", "undemocratic and prone to abuse, resulting in inordinate delays and\ninjustice in the administration of land.\n\n3.5.1 Land Rights Delivery Principles\n\n147. Land rights delivery is the process of mobilizing institutional\nmechanisms and personnel for ascertaining and registering rights.\nThe current system of land rights delivery has not supplied adequate\nserviced land for development; and the limited available serviced\nland is not affordable for the majority of the population. Further, the\nsystem has not achieved equitable distribution of the limited land\nresources. This unsatisfactory land rights delivery system is caused\nby, among others, multiple registration regimes, land speculation,\ncorruption, political interference, poor record keeping and the abuse\nof power by the public agencies mandated to manage land. In order\nto establish an efficient land rights delivery system, the Government\nshall:\n\n(a) Align land rights delivery procedures and processes with this\nPolicy;\n\n(b) Consolidate, harmonize and streamline all land registration\nstatutes to ensure clarity and reduce bureaucratic bottlenecks;\n\n(c) Ensure that land records are authenticated, documented, and their\ncustody and sanctity secured; and\n\n(d) Computerize land records and facilitate access to land\ninformation.\n\n3.5.2 Land Adjudication and Registration Principles\n\n148. Land adjudication is the process of ascertaining and recording rights\nand interests in land claimed by individuals and other entities. Once\nascertained, such rights and interests are entered into a land register,\nwhich facilitates the accuracy of the land information system and\nenables efficient transactions in land.\n\n149. There are too many statutes dealing with the registration of land\nrights. No attempt has been made to harmonize these statutes to ease\nthe process of registration of land rights and facilitate speedy access\nto land registration information. There is a need to harmonize the\nregistration statutes to enhance the efficiency, transparency and\naccountability of the process of land registration.\n\n150. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Enact a \u201cLand Registration Act_ which shall; (i) Recognize and\nprotect all legitimate rights and interests in land held under the\ncategories of land set out in Section 3.3.lof this Policy; and (ii)\n\n35", "Harmonize the statutes dealing with the registration of land\nrights;\n\n(b) Repeal the Land Adjudication Act and Land Consolidation Act;\nand\n\n(c) Repeal the land registration provisions of the Registration of\nTitles Act (RTA) (Cap 281), the Land Titles Act (LTA) (Cap\n282) and the Registered Land Act (RLA) (Cap 300).\n\n3.5.3 Settlement Land Allocation Principles\n\n151. There are no clearly defined procedures for the allocation of land in\nsettlement schemes under the Agriculture Act (Cap 318) leading to\nmanipulation of the lists of allottees and exclusion of the poor and\nthe landless. These problems are compounded by the lack of clearly\ndefined procedures for identifying, and keeping records of genuine\nsquatters and landless people. In addition there are numerous cases\nof underutilized land by allottees.\n\n152.To streamline land settlement procedures and processes, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Bring in all the provisions relating to settlement under the\nAgriculture Act (Cap 318) to the proposed \u201cLand Act_;\n\n(b) Set out in the \u201cLand Act_ a clear framework for:\n\n= identifying, verifying and recording of genuine landless\npeople;\n\n= acquisition of land for establishment of settlement schemes,\n\n\u00ab planning, survey and demarcation of land in settlement\nschemes;\n\n= equitable and accountable allocation of settlement scheme\nland;\n\n(c) Review and streamline the documentation process of settlement\nplots; and\n\n(d) Repossess and reallocate abandoned settlement plots.\n3.5.4 Land Surveying and Mapping\n\n153. The processes of land surveying and mapping are integral to an\nefficient land administration and management system. In addition to\npreparing the maps and plans to support land registration, they map\nthe earth for land use planning.\n\n36", "154. These processes have been hampered by slow, cumbersome and out-\ndated modes of operation, and failure to regulate non-title surveys\nleading to the development of incompatible maps.\n\n155. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Amend the Survey Act (Cap 299) to allow: (i)for the use of\nmodern technology such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n(GNSS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and\nstreamline survey authentication procedures; and (ii) regulation\nof non-title surveys;\n\n(b) Establish a unitary and homogeneous network of control points\nof adequate density, preferably using dynamic technology such\nas GNSS; and\n\n(c) Improve mapping standards in general boundary areas so _ that\nthey fit into a computerized system.\n\n3.5.5 Cadastral Principles\n\n156. An efficient system of land delivery requires adequate capacity for the\npreparation and maintenance of cadastre indicating not merely who\nowns what interest in land, but other details such as land suitability,\nuses, size, distribution and topographical characteristics. Due to\nvarious constraints such as the use of paper records and the slow\npace of land titling, the Kenyan cadastre remains in-optimal.\n\n157. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Modernize the land _ delivery infrastructure, through\ncomputerization and use of other electronically linked systems;\n\n(b) Create human resource capacity to operate the modernized\ninfrastructure; and\n\n(c) Remove constraints to the realization of an optimal cadastre.\n3.5.6 Land Information Management Principles\n\n158. Kenya lacks up to date information on different land uses such as\nagriculture, forestry, wildlife, water and infrastructure. Lack of this\nvital information complicates effective planning, zoning and overall\nmanagement of land.\n\n159. Land information consists of datasets for decision making in land\nadministration and management. These include data on geo-\nreferencing, mapping, land ownership, land rights, land use planning,\nvaluation and inventories of different categories of land.\n\n160. A Land Information Management System (LIMS) is an information\nsystem that enables the capture, management, and analysis of\n\n37", "geographically referenced land-related data in order to produce land\ninformation for decision-making in land administration and\nmanagement.\n\n161. Land information is currently held mostly in paper form and managed\nmanually. This is inefficient, time consuming and cannot support\ntimely decision making.\n\n162. Other deficiencies of the existing LIMS include expensive cadastral\nsurveys, centralization of cadastral processes, and slow, cumbersome\nprocedures.\n\n163. To facilitate the establishment of an efficient land information\nmanagement system, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Establish a comprehensive, computer based, efficient, user\nfriendly, accessible, affordable, transparent and gender sensitive\nland information management system;\n\n(b) Ensure that the land information system facilitates the accurate\nclassification and mapping of all categories of land including\nland claimed by minority groups, pastoral communities, disputed\nland, and land identified to have been irregularly allocated;\n\n(c) Establish national guidelines on land information, to govern\nmatters such as land information \u00a7 standards, security,\ndissemination and pricing;\n\n(d) Make land information available in a form and language that can\nbe understood by most citizens, including accessible and clear\nhard copy information products and simple maps;\n\n(e) Re-organize, update and authenticate existing land records;\n\n(f) Establish a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDIJ) to ensure\nintegration of and access to spatial data sets held by different\nnational and sectoral agencies;\n\n(g) Provide necessary infrastructure, such as electricity, computers\nand internet connectivity at all levels of land administration;\n\n(h) Promote the growth of a viable land information market;\n\n(i) Enact a land information law to facilitate access to and\nmanagement of land information;\n\n(j) Facilitate the sharing of information across Government\ndepartments;\n\n(k) Encourage public-private partnerships in the setting up of and\nadministration of the LIMS;\n\n38", "(1) Create human resource capacity to develop, operate and maintain\na modern LIMS;\n\n(m)Establish a regulatory body for Geo-Information professionals to\ngenerate and develop a code of ethics and to standardize training\nof professionals; and\n\n(n) Establish mechanisms for the incorporation of traditional land\ninformation in the LIMS.\n\n3.5.7 Land Market Principles\n\n164. The development of vibrant land markets is hindered by inadequate\ninformation, political interference, bureaucratic inefficiencies,\ncorruption, speculation, insecure and unclear land tenure\narrangements, and the absence of innovative market mechanisms\nsuch as real estate investment trusts and community land trusts. The\nemergence of new land markets including rental markets should be\nencouraged. These new land markets have the potential to facilitate\nbetter access to land.\n\n165. In order to enhance the efficiency of land markets, the Government\nshall:\n\n(a) Decentralise land registries;\n(b) Facilitate allocation of serviced land for investment purposes;\n\n(c) Facilitate and promote land market operations particularly in\ncommunity land;\n\n(d) Encourage the development of new land markets by, among\nother things, providing better information about land\ntransactions; and\n\n(ce) Regulate land markets to ensure efficiency, equity and\nsustainability.\n\n3.5.8 Fiscal Aspects of Land Management\n\n166. A clear fiscal framework for land management serves a number of\nfunctions, namely: generating public revenue, providing a stable\nfund for the acquisition of land for banking, servicing land,\nfacilitating the efficient utilization of land, providing incentives for\nappropriate land uses, and discouraging speculation. Existing laws\nempower the State and local authorities to assess and collect taxes\nsuch as stamp duty, estate duty and rates.\n\n167. Land taxation assessment and collection procedures under existing\nlaws do not provide effective fiscal management frameworks that\nencourage generating public revenue, discouraging land speculation,\n\n39", "servicing land, efficient utilization of land, incentives for appropriate\nland uses.\n\n168. To facilitate the efficient utilisation of land and land-based resources,\nthe Government shall:\n\n(a) Establish a land taxation regime that facilitates efficiency in\nrevenue collection, utilization and servicing of land, provides\nincentives for appropriate land uses, and discourages land\nspeculation; and\n\n(b) Improve the capacity of public institutions including local\nauthorities to assess and collect taxes.\n\n3.5.9 Dispute Resolution Principles\n\n169. There is a need to ensure access to timely, efficient and affordable\ndispute resolution mechanisms. This will facilitate efficient land\nmarkets, tenure security and investment stability in the land sector.\n\n170. In order to facilitate effective, fair and efficient dispute resolution, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Establish independent, accountable and democratic systems\nbacked by law to adjudicate land disputes at all levels;\n\n(b) Establish appropriate and inclusive institutions for dispute\nresolution and access to justice with clear operational procedures,\nand clear record keeping for making decisions on specific\nmatters; and\n\n(c) Encourage and facilitate the use of Alternative Disputes\nResolution (ADR) mechanisms such as negotiation, mediation\nand arbitration to facilitate speedy and cost effective access to\njustice.\n\n3.6 LAND ISSUES REQUIRING SPECIAL INTERVENTION\n171. Several land related issues deserve special attention. These include:\n(a) Historical injustices;\n(b) Pastoral land issues;\n(c) Coastal region land issues;\n(d) Land rights of minority and marginalized groups;\n(e) Land rights of women;\n(f) Land rights in informal settlements and for informal activities;\n(g) Land rights of children; and\n\n40", "(h) The impact of the HIV and AIDS pandemic on agricultural\nproduction and access to land rights.\n\n3.6.1 Mechanisms for Resolving Special Land Issues\n\n172. In the interest of social and economic development, the Government\nshall put in place measures to resolve land issues requiring special\nintervention taking into account the land reform principles of\nredistribution, restitution and resettlement in order to facilitate access\nto, and utilisation of, land and land-based resources.\n\n3.6.1.1 Redistribution\n\n173. The purpose of land redistribution is to facilitate equitable access to\nland for residential, commercial and other productive purposes.\nThere is a need to establish a clear legal and planning framework for\nidentifying, verifying and recording genuine land use needs, and to\nestablish clear and equitable criteria for redistribution.\n\n3.6.1.2 Restitution\n\n174. The purpose of land restitution is to restore land rights to those that\nhave unjustly been deprived of such rights. It underscores the need to\naddress circumstances which give rise to such lack of access,\nincluding historical injustices. The Government shall develop a legal\nand institutional framework for handling land restitution.\n\n3.6.1.3 Resettlement\n\n175. The resettlement principle seeks to procure adequate land for the\nreorganization of both rural and urban settlements in light of\nexpanding populations, conflicts, historical injustices and disasters.\nThe Government shall: (4) establish criteria for the determination of\nwho qualifies to benefit from resettlement programmes; (ii) ensure\nthat it is carried out in a transparent and accountable manner; and\n(iii) provide them with infrastructure and basic services.\n\n3.6.1.4 Land Banking\n\n176. The implementation of the principles of redistribution, restitution and\nresettlement will depend on the availability of land.\n\n177. To avail land for redistribution, restitution and resettlement, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Establish land banks and make land available for investment and\ndevelopment;\n\n(b) Formulate and implement a government buy-back policy;\n\n(c) Procure land for land banks through purchase and donations; and\n\n4l", "(d) Institute a programme for land reclamation, as provided for in\nsection 3.4.2.4 of this Policy.\n\n3.6.2 Resolution of Historical Land Injustices\n\n178. Historical land injustices are grievances which stretch back to colonial\nland administration practices and laws that resulted in mass\ndisinheritance of communities of their land, and which grievances\nhave not been sufficiently resolved to date. Sources of these\ngrievances include land adjudication and registration laws and\nprocesses, and treaties and agreements between local communities\nand the British. The grievances remain unresolved because\nsuccessive post independence Governments have failed to address\nthem in a holistic manner.\n\n179. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Establish mechanisms to resolve historical land claims arising in\n1895 or thereafter. The rationale for this decision is that 1895 is\nthe year when Kenya became a protectorate under the British\nEast African Protectorate with the power to enact policies and\nlaws under the Crown. It is these colonial practices and laws\nwhich formed the genesis of the mass disinheritance of various\nKenyan communities of their land;\n\n(b) Establish a suitable legal and administrative framework to\ninvestigate, document and determine historical land injustices\nand recommend mechanisms for their resolution;\n\n(c) Review all laws and policies adopted by post independence\nGovernments that exacerbate the historical land injustices;\n\n(d) Establish suitable mechanisms for restitution of historical land\ninjustices and claims; and\n\n(e) Specify a time period within which land claims should be made.\n3.6.3 Pastoral Land Issues\n\n180. Pastoralism is a livestock based economic activity. Pastoralism has\nsurvived as a livelihood and land use system despite changes in life\nstyles and technological advancements. This tenacity of pastoralism\ntestifies to its appropriateness as a production system.\n\n181. Colonial and post-colonial land administration in the pastoralist areas\nled to the deprivation of land management rights from the traditional\ninstitutions thereby creating uncertainty in the access, control and\nexploitation of land based resources including grazing lands, water\nand salt licks among others.\n\n42", "182. Women play diverse roles in pastoral systems, yet they face special\nproblems such as lack of access to land use rights.\n\n183. To secure pastoralists livelihoods and tenure to land, the Government\nshall:\n\n(a) Recognize pastoralism as a legitimate land use and production\nsystem;\n\n(b) Review the Land (Group Representatives) Act and provide for\npastoralism in the \u201cLand Act_;\n\n(c) Establish suitable methods for defining and registering land\nrights in pastoral areas while allowing pastoralists to maintain\ntheir unique land systems and livelihoods;\n\n(d) Establish a legislative framework to regulate transactions in land\nin pastoral areas;\n\n(e) Ensure that the rights of women in pastoral areas are recognized\nand protected;\n\n(f) Provide for flexible and negotiated cross boundary access to\nprotected areas, water, pastures and salt licks among different\nstakeholders for mutual benefit; and\n\n(g) Ensure that all land uses and practices under pastoral tenure\nconform to the principles of sustainable resource management.\n\n3.6.4 Land Issues Peculiar to Coast Region\n\n184. The land question within the Coast region is complex due to its\npeculiar historical and legal origins. The processes of land\nadjudication and registration under the Land Titles Act (Cap 282)\ndeprived many members of the indigenous Coastal Communities of\ntheir land. This led to the area having the largest single concentration\nof landless indigenous people living as squatters. It also gave rise to\nthe problem of absentee land owners. There is also a need to regulate\nthe rights of land owners and tenants in the context of the prevalent\npractice of \u2018tenancies-at-will_ and good planning practice.\n\n185. The slow land adjudication process and delay in finalization of\nsettlement programmes have denied the communities secure access\nto land.\n\n186. The grant of freehold and leasehold tenure on beaches has hampered.\npublic access, movement along the beaches and fishing.\n\n187. The ownership of beaches and some islands within the Indian Ocean\nby foreigners also poses a threat to national security.\n\n43", "188. Salt mining along the coast has not been rationalized with other land\nuses. As a result, salt harvesting companies have acquired large\ntracts of land suitable for agricultural production but which they\nhave left idle. The coastal region hosts unique and _ strategic\ngovernment institutions which include the Kenya Ports Authority\n(KPA), the Kenya Navy Base (KNB) and the Kenya Marine and\nFisheries Research Institute (KEMFRI). Some of the land owned by\nthese institutions has, however, been allocated to private developers\nwithout due consideration of the future development plans of the\ninstitutions.\n\n189. Private developments along and around navigation beacons, ship\nleading lights and other control points have negatively affected the\nmaintenance of these installations.\n\n190. The KPA has in the past reclaimed land from the sea for specific\npublic uses. However, some of the land reclaimed by KPA has been\nallocated to private developers without due consideration for the\nintended use, or security of the port facilities. Increasingly private\ndevelopers have also engaged in land reclamation without authority.\n\n191. The Tana and Sabaki rivers have their deltas in the coastal regions of\nKipini and Malindi respectively. These deltas are Kenya's key\noceanic ecosystems and important wetlands housing unique varieties\nof mangrove trees among other life species. In spite of their\necological importance, speculative land allocation, inappropriate\nland uses as well as inadequate conservation measures are rampant.\n\n192. Lamu Island is a famous World Heritage Site. Unfortunately current\nland use and ownership practices are undermining the sustainability\nof the heritage. In addition, land transactions are now taking place on\nthe island with the result that many local inhabitants are rendered\nlandless.\n\n193. To address the Coastal land problems, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Establish suitable legal and administrative mechanisms to\naddress historical claims arising from the application of the Land\nTitles Act (Cap 282) of 1908;\n\n(b)Take an inventory of all Government land along the :10\nmilecoastal strip\u201d and other parts of the province where the\nproblemof squatters is prevalent and come up with a framework\nforconversion to community land for eventual adjudication\nandresettlement;\n\n(c) Provide a legal framework to protect the tenants at will;\n\n44", "(d) Establish convenient public utility plots along the coastline to\nserve as landing sites and for public recreation, and open up all\npublic access roads to the beach;\n\n(e) Regulate the construction of walls along the high water mark;\n\n(f) Provide a framework for beach management and the protection,\nconservation, and management of land that has been created\nthrough natural recession of the sea or through reclamation from\nthe sea;\n\n(g) Establish a framework for consulting indigenous occupants of\nland before establishing settlement schemes and other land use\nprojects;\n\n(h) Protect and conserve the Tana and Sabaki Delta ecosystems in\ncollaboration with contiguous communities;\n\n(i) Sensitize and educate people on their land rights and land\nadministration and management procedures;\n\n(j) Provide a framework for sharing benefits from land and land\nbased resources with communities;\n\n(k) Initiate and support the preparation of an integrated coast\nresource management plan;\n\n(1) Regulate ownership and use of islands by foreigners taking into\naccount public policy considerations such as national security;\n\n(m)Rationalize salt mining with other land uses; and\n\n(n) Establish mechanisms to regulate all forms of disposal of\nstrategic public institutional land to take into account the future\ndevelopment plans and needs of these institutions.\n\n3.6.5 Land Rights of Vulnerable Groups\n\n194. Vulnerability is a manifestation of poverty and deprivation. It takes\nforms such as lack of adequate shelter, illiteracy, exposure to ill\ntreatment, lack of power to influence decisions affecting one\u2019s life,\nand disabilities. The most vulnerable persons in Kenya include;\nsubsistence farmers, pastoralists, hunters and gatherers, agricultural\nlabourers, unskilled and low-skilled workers, unemployed youth,\npersons with disabilities, persons living with HIV and AIDS,\norphans, slum and street dwellers, and the aged.\n\n195. Poor and vulnerable people lack voice, power and representation in\nsociety, which limits their opportunities to access, use and own land\nand land based resources.\n\n45", "196. The land rights of vulnerable individuals and groups are not\nadequately protected and are subject to bias and discrimination.\nFurther, the vulnerable lack cohesive institutions to represent their\ninterests.\n\n197. To secure access to land and land based resources for vulnerable\ngroups, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Develop mechanisms for identifying, monitoring and assessing\nthe vulnerable groups;\n\n(b) Establish mechanisms for redistribution of land and resettlement;\n\n(c) Facilitate their participation in decision making over land and\nland based resources; and\n\n(d) Protect their land rights from unjust and illegal expropriation.\n3.6.6 Land Rights of Minority Communities\n\n198. Minority communities are culturally dependent on_ specific\ngeographical habitats. Over the years, they have lost access to land\nand land-based resources that are key to their livelihoods. For\nexample, such loss of access follows the gazettement of these\nhabitats as forests or national reserves or their excision and\nallocation to individuals and institutions, who subsequently obtain\ntitles to the land.\n\n199. These communities are not represented adequately in governmental\ndecision making at all levels since they are relatively few in number.\nTheir political and economic marginalization has also been attributed\nto the fact that colonial policies assimilated them into neighbouring\ncommunities. In addition, the colonial Government alienated their\nlands through forest preservation policies, which effectively\nrendered them landless as they were denied the right to live in the\nforests. Colonial administration also led to the marginalization of\nother minority communities both urban and rural, such as hunter-\ngatherers. To protect and sustain the land rights of minority\ncommunities, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Undertake an inventory of the existing minority communities to\nobtain a clear assessment of their status and land rights;\n\n(b) Develop a legislative framework to secure their rights to\nindividually or collectively access and use land and land based\nresources;\n\n46", "(c) Provide legal and institutional frameworks for restitution; and\n\n(d) Support their resource management systems to ensure\nsustainability of land and land based resources.\n\n3.6.7 Disaster Management\n\n200. Kenya experiences disasters that should be managed in order to avoid\nthe loss of human and animal life, the negative impacts on\nagriculture, the natural environment and the destruction of property.\nSuch disasters include floods, earthquakes and landslides. There are\nno legal, policy and institutional frameworks for the prevention and\nmanagement of land-related disasters. There is also a dearth of\nappropriate technologies and financial resources to deal with these\ndisasters.\n\n201. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Establish legal, policy and institutional frameworks for the\nprevention and management of land-related disasters; and\n\n(b) Establish a suitable legal and administrative framework for\nresettlement in the event of natural disasters.\n\n3.6.8 Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons\n3.6.8.1 Refugees\n\n202. Kenya hosts a large number of refugees as a result of civil strife in\nneighbouring countries.\n\n203. Due to the unpredictable nature of refugee influxes, resources such as\nland, fuel wood, water and pasture are overstretched in already\nstressed environments. Widespread underdevelopment of\ninfrastructure in the affected areas exacerbates the situation.\n\n204. The location of refugee camps in fragile ecosystems causes systematic\necological degradation.\n\n205. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Ensure that the establishment of refugee camps is subject to\ndevelopment planning and control;\n\n(b) Put in place a legislative and administrative framework for\nestablishing, planning and managing refugee camps taking into\naccount this Policy, the Environmental Management and\nCoordination Act and other sectoral laws on natural resources;\n\n(c) Build the capacity of relevant ministries, communities and the\nprivate sector to appreciate and address land-related\nenvironmental concerns in refugee camps;\n\n47", "(d) Involve host communities in setting up, planning and managing\nrefugee camps; and\n\n(e) Ensure the provision of adequate resources for the maintenance\nand rehabilitation of refugee camps.\n\n3.6.8.2 Internally displaced persons\n\n206. A significant number of Kenyans have been displaced from their land\nas a result of tribal and land clashes. These people are currently\nhosted in camps for internally displaced persons, roadside\nsettlements, market centres and colonial villages established as\ncommunity concentration centres.\n\n207. There are no legal, policy or institutional frameworks for dealing with\nthe issues that arise from internal displacement.\n\n208. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Undertake an inventory of all genuine internally displaced\npersons;\n\n(b) Identify problems associated with the presence of internally\ndisplaced persons such as additional land pressure and\ncompetition for land based resources;\n\n(c) Establish legal, policy and institutional frameworks for dealing\nwith the issues that arise from internal displacement;\n\n(d) Resettle as appropriate all internally displaced persons; and\n(e) Resettle as appropriate all internally displaced persons.\n3.6.9 Informal Settlements\n\n209. The essence of :informal or :spontaneous or \u2018squatter ~ settlements is\nthe absence of security of tenure and planning. Many Kenyans live\nas squatters, in slums and other squalid places. Squatters and\ninformal settlements therefore present a challenge for land planning\nand development.\n\n210. Squatters are found on all categories of land.\n\n211. To deal with the challenges presented by squatters and informal\nsettlements, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Take an inventory of genuine squatters and people who live in\ninformal settlements;\n\n(b) Determine whether land occupied by squatters is suitable for\nhuman settlement;\n\n48", "(c) Establish appropriate mechanisms for the removal of squatters\nfrom unsuitable land and their resettlement;\n\n(d) Facilitate planning of land found to be suitable for human\nsettlement;\n\n(e) Ensure that land subject to informal settlement is developed in an\nordered and sustainable manner;\n\n(f) Facilitate negotiation between private owners and squatters in\ncases of squatter settlements found on private land;\n\n(g) Facilitate the regularization of existing squatter settlements found\non public and community land for purposes of upgrading or\ndevelopment;\n\n(h) Establish a legal framework and procedures for transferring\nunutilised land and land belonging to absentee land owners to\nsquatters and people living in informal settlements;\n\n(i) Develop, in consultation with affected communities, a slum\nupgrading and resettlement programme under specified flexible\ntenure systems;\n\n(j) Put in place measures to prevent further slum development;\n\n(k) Facilitate the carrying out of informal commercial activities in a\nying\nplanned manner;\n\n(1) Regulate the disposal of land allocated to squatters and informal\nsettlers; and\n\n(m)Establish an appropriate legal framework for eviction based on\ninternationally acceptable guidelines.\n\n3.6.10 Cross-Cutting Issues Requiring Special Intervention\n\n212. This Policy recognizes the following as cross-cutting issues requiring\nspecial intervention: poverty, HIV and AIDS, youth and gender\nissues, and corruption.\n\n213. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Adhere to and enforce the principle of non-discrimination to\nensure that these cross-cutting issues are adequately dealt with;\n\n(b) Facilitate the channelling of resources to address poverty-related\nand HIV and AIDS occasioned problems;\n\n(c) Facilitate the empowerment of youth and women;\n\n(d) Mainstream youth and gender concerns in anti-poverty\nprogrammes; and\n\n49", "(ce) Mainstream anti-corruption measures and facilitate public\neducation and awareness creation programmes for all\nstakeholders.\n\n3.6.10.1 HIV and AIDS\n\n214. The HIV and AIDS pandemic has had a significant impact on\neconomic productivity, specifically on utilisation and production\nfrom land based resources. It has affected the most productive age\nbracket. The pandemic has thus raised the need to reorganise rural\nsettlements with a view to rationalising agricultural production\nsystems. Further, it has adversely impacted on the land rights of\nwidows and orphans, who are invariably disinherited of their family\nland whenever male house heads succumb to illnesses occasioned by\nthe pandemic.\n\n215. The HIV and AIDS pandemic underscores an urgent need to reform\ncultural and legal practices that discriminate against women and\nchildren with respect to access to and ownership of land.\n\n216. The Government shall:\n\n(a) Protect the land rights of people living with HIV and AIDS and\nensure that their rights are not unfairly expropriated by others;\nand\n\n(b) Facilitate public awareness campaigns on the need to write wills\nto protect land rights of dependants.\n\n3.6.10.2 The Rights of Children and Youth\n\n217. Children and youth require special protection in matters related to\nland rights because they are minors under the law and may not be\nconsidered as grantees of land rights. Additionally, culture and\ntradition exclude children and youth from accessing, and making\ndecisions over land.\n\n218. In view of this precarious position and considering the problems\nrelated to HIV and AIDS, children and youth require special\nprotection with regard to their land rights.\n\n219. To protect the rights of children and youth, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Enhance the enforcement of the Children\u2019s Act (Cap 586) and\nsupervise the appointment of guardians for orphans to safeguard\ntheir land rights;\n\n(b) Review the legislative framework to provide that being a minor\ndoes not constitute a barrier to proprietorship where\n\n50", "circumstances indicate that conferring ownership rights upon a\nminor would be appropriate;\n\n(c) Review, harmonize and consolidate all the laws relating to\nchildren\u2019s inheritance of family land in order to recognize and\nprotect the rights of orphans;\n\n(d) Review the laws on trusts and administration of estates with a\nview to ensuring that trustees act in the best interests of the\nbeneficiaries of trusts and estates; and\n\n(e) Carry out public education campaigns so as to encourage the\nabandonment of cultural practices that bar children and youth\nfrom inheriting family land.\n\n3.6.10.3 Gender and Equity Principles\n\n220. Culture and traditions continue to support male inheritance of family\nland while there is lack of gender sensitive family laws. There is a\nconflict between the constitutional provisions and international\ntreaties on gender equality vis-a-vis customary practices that\ndiscriminate against women in relation to land ownership and\ninheritance.\n\n221. Women are not sufficiently represented in institutions that deal with\nland. Their rights under communal ownership and group ranches are\nalso not defined and this allows men to dispose of family land\nwithout consulting women.\n\n222. Few women have land registered in their names and lack of financial\nresources restricts their entry into the land market. Moreover,\nInternational Conventions on women\u2019s rights relevant to women\u2019s\nland rights ratified by the Government of Kenya have not\nsufficiently been translated into policies or laws.\n\n223. To protect the rights of women, the Government shall:\n\n(a) Enact appropriate legislation to ensure effective protection of\nwomen $ rights to land and related resources;\n\n(b) Repeal existing laws and outlaw regulations, customs and\npractices that discriminate against women in relation to land;\n\n(c) Enforce existing laws and establish a clear legislative framework\nto protect the rights of women in issues of inheritance to land and\nland-based resources;\n\n(d) Make provision for joint spousal registration and documentation\nof land rights, and for joint spousal consent to land disposals,\napplicable for all forms of tenure;\n\n51", "(e) Secure inheritance rights of unmarried daughters;\n\n(f) Facilitate public awareness campaigns on the need to write wills\nto protect dependants;\n\n(g) Carry out public education campaigns to encourage the\nabandonment of cultural practices that bar women from\ninheriting family land; and\n\n(h) Ensure proportionate representation of women in institutions\ndealing with land at all levels.\n\n3.6.10.4 Matrimonial Property\n\n224. The existing laws and practices governing matrimonial property\ndiscriminate against spouses whose contribution to the acquisition of\nsuch property is indirect and not capable of valuation in monetary\nterms. Further, the courts have been inconsistent in determining what\namounts to such contribution, with the result that some spouses have\nunfairly been denied of their rights to land.\n\n225.To secure the rights of spouses to matrimonial property, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Review succession, matrimonial property and other related laws\nto ensure that they conform to the principle of gender equity;\n\n(b) Enact specific legislation governing division of matrimonial\nproperty to replace the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1882\nof England;\n\n(c) Protect the rights of widows, widowers and divorcees through\nthe enactment of a law on co-ownership of matrimonial property;\n\n(d) Establish appropriate legal measures to ensure that men and\nwomen are entitled to equal rights to matrimonial property; and\n\n(e) Establish mechanisms to curb selling and mortgaging of family\nland without the involvement of spouses.\n\n3.6.10.5 Corruption\n\n226. Corruption has had serious negative effects on the distribution and\nmanagement of land as a resource. Existing laws dealing with\ncorruption provide for prosecution of offenders and recovery of\nassets. In practice, however, there has been an emphasis on\nprosecution of offenders. As a result, there has been limited recovery\nof land acquired through corruption. Further, public education on\ncorruption in the land sector has been minimal.\n\n52", "227. In order to address the problem of corruption in the land sector, the\nGovernment shall:\n\n(a) Pay due attention to the recovery of assets as an anti-corruption\nmeasure;\n\n(b) Facilitate development and implementation of public education\nand awareness creation programmes targeting:-\n\n(i) | Members of the public;\n(ii) All officers in the Ministry of Lands;\n\n(iii) Institutions envisaged in the NLP (National Land\nCommission, District Land Boards, Community Land\nBoards, Local Authorities, Land Property Tribunals,\nDistrict Land Tribunals, Land Courts and Land Reform\nTransformation Unit).\n\n53", "CHAPTER 4: INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK\n\n228.The existing institutional framework for land administration and\nmanagement is highly centralized, complex, and exceedingly\nbureaucratic. As a result, it is prone to corruption and has not been\nable to provide efficient services. In addition, it does not adequately\ninvolve the public in decision making with respect to land\nadministration and management, and is thus unaccountable.\n\n229. The Government shall overhaul the existing institutional framework\nfor land administration and management to:\n\n(a) Facilitate the delivery of efficient, cost-effective and equitable\nservices;\n\n(b) Ensure devolution of land administration and management;\n\n(c) Facilitate access to land administration and management by the\npoor so that the sector can contribute to poverty reduction; and\n\n(d) Ensure adequate stakeholder participation and accountability in\nland administration and management.\n\n4.1 Structural Reform Principles\n\n230. The institutional reform process will therefore be guided by the\nfollowing key principles:\n\n(a) Devolution of power and authority;\n\n(b) Stakeholder participation;\n\n(c) Operational autonomy;\n\n(d) Effective surveillance and performance monitoring systems;\n\n(e) Access to justice;\n\n(f) Gender and inter generational equity;\n\n(g) Appropriate enforcement mechanisms;\n\n(h) Environmental sustainability; and\n\n(i) Smooth transition from the current to the proposed arrangements.\n4.2 Policy Framework for Land Management Institutions\n\n231. The Government will set up three key land management institutions:\nthe National Land Commission (NLC), the District Land Boards\n(DLBs) and Community Land Boards (CLBs).\n\n4.2.1 The National Land Commission (NLC)\n\n232. The NLC shall be a constitutional body. Its composition shall take\ninto account the need to ensure broad representation, expertise,\nintegrity and equity. The nominees shall be vetted by Parliament and\n\n54", "appointed by the President. The NLC shall be operationalized by an\nAct of Parliament.\n\n233. The NLC shall have the following functions:\n(a) Hold title to and manage public land on behalf of the State;\n\n(b) Establish and maintain a register of all public, private and\ncommunity land in the country;\n\n(c) Ensure the realization of the multiple values of land, namely,\neconomic productivity, equity, environmental sustainability and\nconservation of national heritage;\n\n(d) Exercise the powers of compulsory acquisition and development\ncontrol on behalf of the State and local authorities or\ngovernments;\n\n(e) Levy, collect and manage all land tax revenues except rates\nwhich shall be collected by local authorities or governments;\n\n(f) Develop the capacity of both DLBs and CLBs;\n\n(g) Provide technical services and coordinate the work of DLBs and\nCLBs through establishment of NLC district offices;\n\n(h) Ensure the development and operation of effective digital Land\nInformation Management Systems at all levels;\n\n(i) Establish a Land Policy Research Centre (LPRC) in partnership\nwith universities and research institutions to coordinate land\npolicy research;\n\n(j) Establish and manage a National Land Trust Fund (NLTF) to\nmobilize and pool financial resources for implementing this\nPolicy. The NLTF shall be administered by the NLC; and\n\n(k) Provide technical support to the Ministry in-charge of land in\npreparation and implementation of a national land use policy and\nother land related policies.\n\n234. Within two years of its establishment, the NLC shall initiate the\nprocess of formulating necessary legal and administrative reforms to\nfacilitate timely implementation of this policy including resolution of\nhistorical land injustices.\n\n4.2.1.1 Independence and Accountability of the NLC\n\n235. The existing legislative practice of giving Ministers the \u201cpower to\ngive directions of a general nature_ to public agencies has invariably\ncompromised their independence including agencies dealing with\nland.\n\n55", "236. The NLC should be accorded sufficient autonomy and independence\nto perform its functions effectively and fairly. It should, however, be\naccountable to the people of Kenya.\n\n237. In order to ensure the independence and accountability of the NLC,\nthe Government shall enact a :National Land Commission Act\u2019 to:\n\n(a) Grant the NLC operational autonomy;\n\n(b) Require the NLC to be accountable to Parliament for its\noperations;\n\n(c) Require ministerial policy directions to the NLC to be laid before\nParliament in writing; and\n\n(d) Facilitate public participation and application of democratic\nprinciples in the establishment and management of the NLC.\n\n4.2.1.2 The NLC District Offices\n\n238. The NLC district offices will have several technical sections that are\nneeded to facilitate land administration and management including\nland use planning, land adjudication, settlement services, surveying\nand mapping, recording of transactions, land information\nmanagement, issuance of titles, and land valuation for operational\nland markets.\n\n239. The transactions of the district land registry will cover private, public\nand community land.\n\n240. The personnel of the NLC district offices shall be appointed on the\nbasis of established guidelines, standards and appropriate\nqualifications.\n\n4.2.2 The District Land Boards (DLBs)\n\n241.The DLBs shall act as agents of the NLC at the district level and be\naccountable to the NLC in the performance of their functions.\n\n242. The DLBs shall be composed of democratically elected community\nrepresentatives and supported by officers appointed by NLC.\n\n243. The DLBs shall be managed according to the structural reform\nprinciples outlined in this Policy while paying special attention to the\nneeds of different communities.\n\n244. The officers of the DLBs shall be appointed by the NLC on the basis\nof established guidelines, standards and appropriate qualifications.\n\n245. District Land Boards shall have the mandate of promoting equitable\naccess to land, conservation of cultural sites, and protecting minority\nland rights. They will administer public and private land on behalf of\nthe NLC.\n\n56", "246. Other functions of DLBs shall include:\n\n(a) Facilitating the efficient operation of land markets at the district\nlevel;\n\n(b) Determining area of jurisdiction of CLBs; and\n\n(c) Monitoring and evaluating land reform programmes at the\ndistrict level.\n\n4.2.3 Community Land Boards\n\n247. Community Land Boards (CLBs) shall constitute the third tier of the\ndevolved land administration and management.\n\n248.
